{"text": "Daily  Turun Sanomat  writes that demand for English-speaking early childhood education in Finland remains steady outside the Helsinki region too and that daycare centres also offer instruction in many other languages. \n Katri Mantere  from the City of Tampere says there are several private institutions offering daycare in English. “In addition, we have one English-language group in a municipal daycare centre,” she says. \n At the moment, 240 children are enrolled in English-language early years education in Tampere. “Our supply meets demand,” Mantere adds. Early years education is also available in French and German in Tampere. \n What is more, Tampere and some other cities organise so-called \"language showers\" or language immersion programmes, where language teacher students from local universities visit daycare centres to teach and play with children. So far, such immersion groups have been organised in English, Spanish, Chinese, Swedish, French, German, Russian and Italian. \n \"These events serve as a basis for the culture and language education that daycare institutions offer on their own,\" says  Outi Verkama ,who coordinates the project in Tampere. \n \"They increase the feeling of community and participation,\" Verkama says. \n Meanwhile, about 600 children in Turku are enrolled in English, French, Spanish, Russian or Estonian-language early years education. \n “Most of them are in English groups,” says  Vesa Kulmala  from the City of Turku. “The number has remained quite steady over the years,” he adds. \n In Oulu, early childhood education is available in English, German and Sámi, TS writes. \n Growth to slow \n Daily  Kaleva  reports that Finland’s economic growth is forecast to slow down more than previously expected next year. \n According to the Research Institute of Finnish Economy Etla, because of its small size Finland is sensitive to fluctuations in the global economy and market sentiment, which have recently become more pessimistic. \n What happens in the UK next year will have a significant effect on Finland, Kaleva writes. Etla director  Vesa Vihriälä  says Britain will likely organise a new referendum on its relationship with the European Union. \"The alternatives are either accepting PM May’s agreement, a no-deal Brexit or remaining a EU-member,\" Vihriälä said in a statement, according to Kaleva. \n \"With some luck, the last option will gain the most votes,\" he added. \n Etla also foresees that the relationship between the US and China will worsen next year. Retail sales and industrial production in China have already slowed and the trade war with the US could accelerate a global downturn, Kaleva writes. \n Slick sidewalks \n Finally, tabloid  Iltalehti  warns readers that sidewalks are likely to be slippery on Friday. Temperatures will rise slightly during the day, and it will be mild and cloudy in most areas of southern and south-western Finland. As a result, frozen snow on sidewalks and above-zero temperatures will cause moisture to build up on top of icy street surfaces, IL says. \n According to  Juha Sihvonen  from the Finnish Meteorological Institute, this is \"a perilous combination for pedestrians.\" \n Fellow tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  says pedestrians in southern Finland should choose their footwear carefully on Friday and wear spiked shoes, if possible. \n Slippery pedestrian pathways tend to show up in accident unit statistics during the winter. Figures indicate that altogether Finland sees some 16,000 different kinds of falling, slipping or stumbling every year. Roughly 11,000 of them involve pedestrians."}

Meanwhile other rescue services across the country have pointed out that if conditions feel too windy it would be wisest not to set off fireworks. \n Yle meteorologist  Anne Borgström  said on Monday that just as Helsinki residents ring in the New Year, the wind will be at its fiercest, gusting up to 20 metres per second. \n Helsinki rescue services tweeted Monday morning that it would monitor the weather during the day and issue possible restrictions on fireworks use later in the day. \n Southwest Finland should also brace for high winds along with rain, sleet and snow. Emergency services in the southwest and Ostrobothnia said that they are monitoring the situation closely and will issue additional warnings on Monday. \n Wind speed to affect fireworks \n Meanwhile, officials are warning revellers to be especially careful using fireworks given the windy conditions expected, and have cautioned that pyrotechnics could veer in unexpected directions as a result. \n Ostrobothnia and southwest Finland emergency services said that if conditions worsen, it may be necessary to consider restricting their use altogether. The storm is expected to make landfall in Ostrobothnia around 8.00pm, while the revellers can begin using fireworks from 6.00pm. \n \"We are now actively following how the winds are developing and we will make a decision about whether or not the weather will affect fireworks or otherwise on New Year’s Eve,\" said duty fire officer  Riikka Oravainen  of the Ostrobothnia rescue services. \n Consumers do not have to observe any official wind speed limits when using fireworks, but professionals do. According to the Fireworks Promotion Association, it is not considered safe for professionals to use fireworks when wind speeds exceed 14 metres per second. \n Windy and snowy across the country \n The New Year is expected to usher in windy and snowy conditions throughout the country, with the stormiest weather due on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to Yle meteorologist  Matti Huutonen , the wind will reach dangerously high speeds on those days. \n Central Finland and the Kainuu region in the east could be blanketed by 30 centimetres of snow, while in the south, precipitation is likely as rain as conditions become milder.

According to the FMI, winds will start to die down in land areas on Wednesday afternoon, but gusty winds will continue in the Sea of Bothnia, Sea of Åland, Sea of Archipelago and the Gulf of Finland. \n Trees have fallen on rail tracks and damaged electric lines between Laihia and Vaasa in western Finland. As a result, trains to Seinäjoki are being replaced by buses. Similarly, trains have been replaced by busses between Joutseno and Muukko in southern Karelia where lines have been damaged by fallen trees.

{"text": "Tuesday night saw a weather system dump heavy snow over much of Finland. While conditions had cleared in many areas Wednesday morning, motorists in the south and southeast still had to contend with local snow flurries and freezing drizzles, which  created dangerous driving conditions . \n Yle meteorologist  Seija Paasonen  said that Tuesday night had seen heavy snowfall in many parts of Helsinki. \"In 12 hours the biggest deposits were in Helsinki's Kaisaniemi district.

{"text": "Dozens of upper secondary school students in the capital region are likely to be absent from school on Friday, writes daily  Helsingin Sanomat , as many of them head to central Helsinki to demonstrate about climate change. \n For example, a group of students at a Kauniainen school will participate in the so-called climate strike to demand more action from decision-makers and business leaders. \n “I’m not allowed to vote, so I’m trying to make a difference in this way,” says 17-year-old  Cecilia Andersin  from Gymnasiet Grankulla samskolan – a Swedish-language upper secondary school in Kauniainen. \n A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published late last year says immediate and major action will be needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C. \n ”The report makes for a discouraging reading, but we cannot become despondent. We need to act for our future and the future of our grandchildren,” says student  Emilia Hanhirova , 19. \n A protest, which will take place in front of Parliament, has attracted a fair amount of interest on Facebook, says HS. \n The Kauniainen school does not support the strike. “It’s good that young people are active, but a strike is not the right means to have an impact. A strike will have a negative effect on school work, which is not the students’ intention either,” says  Niklas Wahlström , principal at the Kauniainen school. \n “Attending the protest on Friday will be considered an unauthorised absence,” he adds. \n ”Climate and environment are issues that apply to everyone. Having interest in them should not make one an activist,” says Hanhirova, who participated in the climate march in Helsinki at the end of October. \n The climate strike is inspired by a similar event that has been going on each Friday in front of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm since last autumn. It was started by 15-year-old  Greta Thunberg , who addressed the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, last month. \n Avalanche risk \n In other environmental news, tabloid  Iltalehti  writes that climate change has increased the risk of avalanches in Finland. \n “There used to be between one and three avalanches in the Ylläs region per year. But their number has risen in the past years. What’s more, tourism has really picked up so more people are at risk, especially those who do off-piste skiing,” says  Tuomo Poukkanen , Ski Resort Director at Ylläs in Kolari, 160 km north of Rovaniemi. \n Climate change is to blame for this increase, says climate researcher  Markku Kulmala , but not just rising temperatures but also more extreme weather conditions. \n \"The amount of precipitation has increased and rains are more intense. A large quantity of snow may fall in a short period of time, which increases the risk of avalanches,\" he says. \n Poukkanen agrees. ”As weather and temperature change suddenly, layers develop within snow. Some of these layers are weak, and will remain there for the whole winter season.” \n Nevertheless, the risk of an avalanche remains much smaller in Finland than in Norway, for example, because of the different terrain, Iltalehti says. \n Last week, four off-piste skiers, three of them Finnish, went missing in northern Norway and  are now presumed dead , buried under an avalanche. \n Liquorice pipe rules \n The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health believes that regulating pipe-shaped liquorice sweets will have a positive effect on Finns’ health, reports daily  Maaseudun Tulevaisuus . \n “According to the WHO, items resembling tobacco products should be regulated in a way that does not further the sale of tobacco products,” says ministerial adviser  Meri Paavola  from the ministry. \n Timo Nisula  – the owner of liquorice factory Kouvolan Lakritsi –  said on Monday  he’s appalled that grocery stores are banned from paying bonuses to customers who buy liquorice pipes, similarly to real tobacco products, MT reports. \n “Nobody in the ministry can seriously believe that selling liquorice pipes increases pipe smoking among young people. Finland has a few war veterans who still smoke a pipe. If the ministry bans our liquorice pipes, we will start to call them saxophones or sea horses. That will make the ministry happy,” Nisula said. \n Paavola says liquorice pipes fall into the same category as flavoured e-cigarettes. “I believe that regulating imitation tobacco products truly makes a difference,” she said."}
{"text": "A group of upper secondary school students, mainly from Swedish-speaking schools in the Helsinki region gathered on the steps of the Finnish parliament Friday to call for action to combat climate change. \n \"Take action!\" and \"Save the planet!\" read some of the placards on display. \n The young adults launched the protest to call for politicians and business leaders to make environmentally-friendly choices. \n Young people also presented a list of demands to lawmakers. Heikki Saukkomaa / Lehtikuva \n Axel Broman from the Grankulla Gymnasium in Kauniainen, Espoo said that more decisions need to take the climate into account. \n \"It’s true that decision-makers are doing something about it, but more needs to be done. These decisions need to be made now, we can’t wait any longer. We need to be braver. And this demonstration shows that we too want to make difficult decisions,\" he said, adding that young people are pioneers in this regard. \n \"This is our future so sometimes we care more than the adults themselves,\" he charged. \n Calls for a climate tax, a change in habits \n Veronica Winqvist of Gymnasiet Lärkan in Helsinki agreed that leaders are not doing enough. \n \"I believe that we should invest more in renewable energy and introduce new laws. We should introduce a climate tax for items that generate a lot of carbon dioxide emissions,\" she declared. \n \"I think that decision-makers haven’t done enough about this. There is a lot that still needs to be done and that’s why we are here,\" said Veronica’s schoolmate Marcus Schramko. \n “It’s now or never,” one student said. Heikki Saukkomaa / Lehtikuva \n Meanwhile Alvar Winqvist of the same school said that he was worried about climate change. \n \"Some work has been done to curb climate change but it hasn’t been enough. It [warming of the climate] should be limited to 1.5 degrees,\" he noted. \n \"One of the most effective methods would be to have some kind of emissions levy so we could really tax the things that pollute. This would be a natural way to ensure the entire society is more climate friendly,\" he added. \n The young protesters also presented a joint list of demands with questions that lawmakers had the opportunity to answer. \n \"We still have to live here for another 50 years\" \n Livia Wikström and Jenina Nyström of Töölö Gymnasium held up signs reminding onlookers that young people’s future is at stake. \n Both said there was no question that they would join the demonstration. \n \"We all need to do something otherwise nothing will happen. Soon it will be too late. It’s now or never,\" Wikström said. \n \"If we do nothing then nothing will change. We still have to live here for another 50 years or more. Maybe we can reduce airline travel, we can cycle instead of driving, or we can eat less meat and buy recycled clothing.\""}

We have sometimes had mass in the snow church,\" said local vicar  Juha Eklund . \n So far no one has exchanged wedding vows in the chapel, although it is possible to do so and the parish has offered the service. However anyone who fancies the idea of a fairy-tale wedding in the frosty house of worship will have to hurry. By March the sun’s rays will render the structure unusable. \n An eight-year tradition \n This winter marks the eighth year that members of the community have volunteered to build the church. In that time they have honed their skills using snow as construction material. \n As a result two of the walls are about 60 centimetres thick, while the other two walls are ten centimetres thinner. \n \"This way the January sun is not a problem, but in March it will warm and melt the walls more on those sides, that’s why we make them thicker,\" Eklund explained. \n Story continues after photo. \n Installing the metre-high windows. Petri Kivimäki / Yle \n Clean, dry frosty snow works best for building as its quality is uniform and it has no lumps. Two tractors are used to bring fresh snow to the building site from an ice skating rink at Lappeenranta’s Vanha field a few kilometres away. \n The construction team comprised a core team of 10 people who have put the church together each year. They managed to erect the walls – just shy of three metres tall – in about four hours. \n Interior work focused on elements such as a large snow altar. Windows are made of ice that comes from an ice machine to ensure there are no bubbles or impurities. The window elements are one metre high, half-a-metre wide and 25 centimetres thick. \n Story continues after photo. \n Vesa Toivanen checks his handiwork with a spirit level.

Centuries ago another church occupied the site, but was prone to lightning strikes because of the high ground. \n In fact a lightning strike in 1790 caused the old church to burn to the ground, after which the site was abandoned. The snow church can be said to be a memorial to the original that was destroyed by the forces of nature."}

Instead of fancy graphics and complex explanations, they attributed the weather to the work of supernatural spirits. \"Puhuri\" was the spirit of biting winds, of the cold and of winter. Today, the paper says, we are seeing \"Puhuri weather\". \n The Finnish Meteorological Institute has issued four different warnings. There is an extreme cold warning for the whole of the country. Most coastal areas have frozen sea warnings. There are high wind warnings in the Gulf of Finland, and a warning of hazardous driving conditions in the west and south, as well as very hazardous condition in the southwest. \n Tuesday may see \"chaos\" on the roads, writes Iltalehti, as a snow storm is expected to sweep across most of the country on Monday night and Tuesday. By Wednesday, southern areas are forecast to have 10-20cm of new snow accumulation, with winds piling up deep snow drifts. \n The paper notes that the Meteorological Institute is reminding drivers to keep a safe assured distance in traffic and to use their fog lights. It might be a good idea to delay any non-essential road travel until the weather improves. If that's not possible, Iltalehti advises packing extra warm clothes, food and drink while travelling. Above all, it writes, reserve lots of time to get wherever you are going. \n What the kids want  \n The Kuopio-based Savon Sanomat is among the papers today that carries  an item about a survey  that asked 13-15 year-old school children what they consider to be the most important social or political issues as Finland approaches elections to a new parliament. \n The poll, commissioned by the Finnish Newspapers Association, found that the biggest concern in this age group is climate and environmental protection. They say that this is what they hope that MPs and the government will focus on. They also want politicians to give more attention to developing schools and reducing social inequalities. \n The majority said that they would like to have a chance to influence these issues. \n The march of English \n The daily Helsingin Sanomat reports that researchers are surprised by how much the use of  English has become a part of the daily life  of Swedish-speaking teens in Finland. \n Quoting a study by the Magman think tank, the paper says that a quarter of teens whose mother tongue is Swedish use a significant amount of English regularly outside the home. \n Jenny Stenberg-Sirén , a researcher for Magman, told the Helsingin Sanomat that while there is regional variation, it was surprising that overall, Swedish-speaking teens use very little Finnish with friends, in their hobbies or at school. Online, the use of English is even more striking. Of the 800 teens interviewed, 47% said they primarily use English online, 40% Swedish and only 10% Finnish. \n \"They live as Swedish speakers, even though there is lots of talk that Swedish-speaking Finns consistently speak Finnish, and that Swedish-language skills are on the decline,\" says Stenberg-Sirén. \n Asked whether or not many young Finnish and Swedish speakers use English together, rather than one of the national languages, Stenberg-Sirén point out that it probably depends a lot on where they live. \"In the Helsinki region, people assume that Swedish-speakers also speak Finnish. But if someone does not speak it well, then what language do you choose to use?\" \n The popularity of English among these teens may in part be explained by the feeling that one doesn't have to speak it as well as Finnish. It is \"permissible\" to pause or make mistakes. The same goes for Finnish-speakers who don't feel fully competent in Swedish. Using English, says Stenberg-Sirén, may be more relaxed on both sides. \n PM's aborted house offer \n In 2015, Centrist Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä  made headlines here, and abroad, with  an announcement that he would open his home  in Kempele, just outside of Oulu, to a family of refugees. \n The offer was later withdrawn, on the advice of security officials. \n Oulu's Kaleva is one of the dailies that picked up  fresh comments on the affair  made by Sipilä in an Yle radio broadcast on Sunday. \n Sipilä said that the intention was that a family which had suffered persecution in their home country would have moved into the house. He described them as Christians from a majority Islamic country who had been persecuted for helping western development aid workers. He did not state what country. \n Arrangements for the family to move into Sipilä's house were never completed, as security officials felt that they would have faced a dangerously high level of hostility. \n \"We could not have imagined that the atmosphere would have become so bad that a family with children who found asylum here would have to fear for their lives,\" Sipilä told reporters. \"Fortunately, that family is now safe elsewhere.\" \n At the time, Sipilä's decision to take asylum seekers into his home aroused harsh criticism from anti-immigration quarters which claimed that the move would boost the number of people seeking asylum in Finland. There were also protests held near his house and incidents of rocks and fireworks thrown at local refugee centres. \n Prime Minister Sipilä has rejected all criticism of his decision at the time. On Sunday, he condemned criminal actions by some asylum seekers, but stated that he stands for the defense of human dignity and basic rights."}
{"text": "Months of bone-chilling temperatures have turned much of the Bay of Bothnia into thick slabs of ice. Finnish icebreaker  Sisu  is now headed toward the region, and according to the ship's chief officer  Patrik Barck , it seems like there will be a lot of ice to deal with this winter. \n Sisu is the fifth icebreaker sent out so far this season, which is early compared to last year, when the fifth icebreaker was deployed some two weeks later on 10 February. \n In 2017, ice levels on most of Finland's seas were  very low , as well. \n Yle caught up with Barck as he and the large icebreaker assisted a cargo ship navigate through the icy waters of Inkoo on the south coast on Sunday. \n \"The ice arrived early this year. We're about two weeks ahead of schedule,\" Barck said. \n Sisu is headed north to the Bay of Bothnia where the ice is increasingly building up. \n On Monday evening, the beige and black icebreaker is scheduled to begin assisting vessels to port and carving out paths in frozen waters off the coasts of Jakobstad (Finnish name  Pietarsaari ) and Kokkola. \n Entire bay likely to freeze over \n \"The ice is increasing all the time and we expect that all of the Bay will be covered in ice this year,\" he said. \n At the moment, however, the situation is fairly calm. Usually there's more ice on the Finnish side of the Bay, but this winter winds from the east have led to increased accumulation of ice on the Swedish side. \n Story continues after photo. \n File photo of icebreaker Fennica at work.  Arctia \n Wind poses the biggest challenge to icebreakers like Sisu. On the Finnish side of the Bothnian Bay the thickness of the ice rarely grows more than a meter deep, but if it's very windy, the ice can build up significantly. \n \"Those ice walls can grow to be 10 metres or up to 20 metres of thick ice. That [kind of situation] always causes problems to assist boats,\" Barck said. \n In ideal weather conditions around seven or eight ships can be escorted through the freezing waters by icebreakers, but Barck said that winter storms have become increasingly common in recent years. \n \"That means more work for us. The ships are unable to move [in poor conditions] using their own engines, so we have to tow them through the ice walls,\" he said. \n The next land call Sisu is scheduled to make is in about a week, on 4 February, in order to change crew and load up supplies. But it will be a good while before the icebreaker returns to its home harbour in Helsinki. \n \"I reckon we'll head back south after 1 May. Normally the first icebreakers head north in November and December and the last ones return in May or June,\" Barck said."}
{"text": "Under-staffing was  central to the business model at the Esperi Care chain  of elder care homes rather than a problem that management struggled with, daily Helsingin Sanomat reports on Wednesday. Reporter  Tiina Rajamäki  sat down with two former managers to talk about the firm's practices after  reports of widespread negligence  at its facilities dominated headlines this week. \n Both spoke on condition of anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements they had signed. One ex-manager of a facility in western Finland said that Esperi Care senior management ordered them to systematically reduce nurses' working hours on shift rota by five percent, although the company had pledged to provide 100 percent staffing in its supplier agreement with the local municipality. \n Another Esperi Care alumnus who worked in the capital region claimed that in a job interview, ex-CEO  Marja Aarnio-Isohanni  outlined a number of measures to save on personnel spending. The goal was to first start by cutting costs on cleaning, then on food and finally on elder care. The guidance provided to supervisors was to hire substitutes to allow nurses to work during a two-hour morning peak time, go home, and then return to work for another peak period during the evening. \n Moreover, they were encouraged to favour non-Finnish-speaking substitutes since they were less likely than native Finns to be as familiar with labour laws. The former head of the western Finland unit said that as a result, they ended up with \"nurses who wouldn't find work elsewhere.\" \n  Sidewalk injuries triple \n With snowy conditions set to continue into next week, tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reports that the slick,  slippery weather is putting more people than usual in hospital  with weather-related injuries.  Mika Paavola , medical chief of staff at Helsinki's Töölö hospital, said that cases of broken wrists, collar bones and ankles have tripled this winter. \n \"We have had heavy loads for several weeks. Many people who've slipped and those who've been hurt otherwise have come to the hospital,\" he told IS. The physician said that there has been a shortage of personnel, especially in operating theatres as well as on wards. At the same time, patients have faced longer queues to see a doctor and get a diagnosis. \n He noted that the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district, HUS, is currently cooperating with the Finnish Meteorological Institute, FMI, to be better able to prepare for weather-related injuries. Paavola warned pedestrians to exercise care as weather conditions become milder next week. \n Rape conviction overturned \n Tabloid Iltalehti reports on a case in which  an appeal court overturned rape charges  against a young Turku man after determining that the defendant and his accuser had been in a relationship and that there was insufficient evidence to convict the 20-year-old charged with the crimes. \n Altogether the appeal court dismissed four rape charges and a five-month suspended sentence imposed by the Southern Karelia district court. He was also ordered to pay a total of just over 3,500 euros in costs and damages. The appellate court referenced a precedent case decided by the Supreme Court, which ruled that a victim's \"truthful and convincing account also needs to be supported by indirect [independent] evidence to ensure accuracy.\" \n The Eastern Finland appeal court said that it was indisputable that at the time that the alleged deeds had been committed in 2016, the pair had been in a relationship and that they had been intimate. It also described the accounts of both accuser and defendant as credible and for the most part consistent. However the court ruled that there was doubt regarding the defendant's guilt and it dismissed the charges. The 21-year-old man was freed and was also relieved of any obligation to pay costs and damages."}
{"text": "Finland's weather will turn milder on Thursday, with more snow and sleet in store for this weekend. \n Snow continues through nearly all of the country on Wednesday, except on the Åland Islands where it has turned to rain. Precipitation will drift away from southern and western Finland during the day. \n By afternoon the precipitation will be mostly limited to eastern and northern Finland. There may be some breaks in the cloud cover in the west, with a few lingering flurries, says Finnish Meteorological Institute meteorologist  Ari Mustala . \n Driving conditions remain poor on Wednesday from southern Finland through northern Ostrobothnia, Kainuu, and up to Sodankylä in Finnish Lapland. The FMI warns of very bad road conditions in Uusimaa, Kymenlaakso and southern Karelia due to snowy surfaces and blowing snow. \n Meanwhile state rail operator VR says that more than a dozen trains are running late on Wednesday. Most delays range between 25 and 35 minutes, but a train from Helsinki to Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle was nearly an hour and a half behind schedule. A morning train from Joensuu to Pieksämäki was replaced by buses between Heinävesi and Pieksämäki because of a freight train breakdown on that track segment. For the latest delays, visit VR's  Traffic Info page . \n The HSL mass transit system in the capital region has also announced an array of delays and cancellations on Wednesday. About 20 commuter train departures, including some between Helsinki and the airport, have been cancelled. Meanwhile half a dozen bus departures, mostly in Espoo and eastern Helsinki, have been scratched due to blocked roads and other problems. Details are listed on the  HSL site . \n Above zero on Sunday? \n A major low-pressure area over the Baltic Sea is moving slowly toward the White Sea in north-west Russia. \n Compared to the near-constant barrage of snow earlier in the week, Wednesday brings brighter conditions with diminishing precipitation in all areas. There is now at least 25 cm of snow on the ground throughout mainland Finland, with 50 to 60 cm in broad swaths of the south, east and north – the deepest being in the far east. \n Temperatures are set to rise to just under the freezing point in southern parts. In central Finland and most of Lapland the mercury will hover between -5 and -10 degrees. It will however be much colder in the far north-western arm, remaining around -20. \n Little precipitation is expected on Thursday, but the snow returns on Friday evening and early Saturday in the south and west, followed by more snow, sleet and rain on Sunday – when temperatures may rise above freezing in southernmost Finland, likely bringing more messy road conditions. \n 12.06: VR & HSL delay information updated."}
{"text": "A new low-pressure front will start crossing into Finland late Saturday night, bringing between 10 and 20 centimetres of snow to southern and central areas on Sunday. \n The snowfall will not extend north into Finnish Lapland until Monday, while frigid temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius there are predicted to continue. Temperatures will be much warmer in the south, where the mercury may even rise above the freezing point at times. \n During the snowfall in the lower parts of the country, Yle meteorologists  Henri Nyman  and  Matti Huutonen  say winds could gust at close to 15 meters per second at their strongest. \n \"In other words, the snow is going to blow around and create drifts. The storm could be the worst we've seen this winter, especially if it continues into Monday,\" they say. \n Hazardous conditions for planes, trains and automobiles \n They say the blustery conditions will create dangerous traffic conditions in all of the areas affected and choppy waters at sea. Even though the worst of the snowfall will likely take place overnight, the weather experts predict that the new snow cover may cause problems for road, railway and even air traffic in the next few days. \n The added snow may cause other safety concerns, too, as many trees branches in the central areas of Finland in particular are already carrying heavy snow burdens. Hard winds and even more weight could mean that some trees and branches start falling, cutting power lines and potentially causing serious damage. \n Yet another round of snow may be heading towards Finland on Monday as well. If it does arrive, Yle meterologist  Joonas Koskela  says it will dump the most snow in southeastern areas. He warns that driving conditions in this part of Finland will be very bad on Monday."}
{"text": "Road conditions in southern and central Finland are very hazardous this Sunday due to new heavy snowfall. Over 11 centimetres of new snow fell on Helsinki and Espoo overnight, for example. \n High winds with blowing snow continue to hamper visibility in areas, and have helped to form large drifts that maintenance crews are working overtime to remove. \n \"Some smaller roads may be blocked altogether. Many cars are stuck,\" says  Kirsi Salokanto , a traffic officer with Traffic Management Finland. \n Although ploughs and front-end loaders are out in force, the authorities ask that motorists who must venture out into traffic reserve extra time and exercise caution. \n Helsinki's Rescue Services unit also warns pedestrians about snow and ice that might fall from rooftops in the city. It advises people on the pavement to avoid walking in potentially dangerous areas, and reminds property managers to remove snow and ice that could pose a hazard at once. \n Delays at airports and train stations \n Airport operator Finavia has released a bulletin saying that the \"challenging snow conditions\" may cause delays. Several flights at the Helsinki Airport have been behind schedule Sunday morning, despite the famous snow clean-up team there doing its best to keep the runways open. \n At least five long-distance trains were delayed on Sunday morning, as the train operator VR also warned ticketholders about possible timetables changes. Commuter N-train routes have been cut back to enable snow removal work on the tracks. \n Newspaper deliveries have also been interrupted in the capital city area, according to some reports. \n The latest snowfall has not caused any major power outages in Finland so far. Just over 2,500 homes and businesses were reported without electricity in 39 central and southern municipalities as of around noon. \n The snowfall is expected to continue through the day on Sunday, and more snow is in the forecast for Monday and Tuesday, in southeast and central areas in particular."}
{"text": "Rarely does a single domestic event cause such an outpouring of reports and commentary as has  the passing of ski jumping legend , later entertainer and staple of tabloid headlines,  Matti Nykänen . \n Many papers on Tuesday carried dozens of items about Nykänen, reviewing his  accomplishments and his personal tragedies . \n Iltalehti, among them, wrote that  a sense of sorrow at the news  of Nykänen's death stopped the Finns in their tracks. The paper described him as being in many ways an exceptional Finn, both as an athlete and as a private individual. \n The five-time Olympic medal winner became, in this paper's words, \"the whole nation's Matti\". \n \"Nykänen's death is naturally a huge shock and a loss to his family and friends, but the loss of this athlete, who rose to the status of national hero, brought the whole of Finland together on Monday and had masses of people remembering him, the greatest ski jumper of all time.\" \n Taxing the lottery \n A Finance Ministry  report published on Monday  stated that Finland's next government will need to find an extra two billion euros by 2023 in order to ensure fiscal sustainability. The alternatives are the standard ones - spending cuts or tax rises. \n In a bylined column in the economic and business daily  Kauppalehti , the paper's news chief  Mikko Metsämäki  suggests that the next government could find a big chunk of that money by taxing winners of the national lottery. \n This week, the first prize in the lottery is a record 15.5 million euros, money paid out tax-free to the winner, or winners. \n Veikkaus, which runs the lottery, does pay a nominal 10 percent tax on the pots it gives out, but if wins were taxed at, say 30 percent, that would bring an extra half a billion euros into state coffers annually. \n Metsämäki has made the same suggestion in the past. At that time the Finance Ministry commented that technically, taxing lottery wins would be easy, but it would require a political decision and a change in the ideology of state-sponsored gambling. \n On the political aspects, he says somewhat tongue in cheek, that the Conservative's position is that work must always be profitable, but winning the lottery should be even more profitable; the Social Democrats want more money for elder care, as long as it doesn't come from lottery winners; the Centre sees the lottery as the last hope in many rural communities, so it can't be touched. \n On a more serious note, Metsämäki says that the consensus among all the political parties is that it is more important to impose a punitive \"solidarity tax\" on anyone earning more than 70,000 a year than it is to bolt the door to the country's own domestic tax haven. \n Record cold and rail cancellations \n A new record low temperature for this winter was recording at Utsjoki in the far north of Finnish Lapland overnight when the thermometer briefly dropped to -39.1C. \n Ilta-Sanomat  reports that the Finnish Metrological Institute said that the temperature soon then rose slightly as some low cloud cover moved into the area. \n The all-time low temperature in Finland was seen in January 1999 when a bone-chilling -51.5C was recorded in Lapland at Kittilä. \n Snow and cold are responsible for rail traffic disruptions and a string of cancellations by the state railways VR. \n Turun Sanomat  reports that VR is blaming what it describes as \"challenging weather conditions\". Low temperatures and deep accumulation of snow has put a strain on both rolling stock and track infrastructure. \n Although VR has targeted keeping 95 percent of long-distance trains in operation, engines and cars are in need of thawing and maintenance. \n According to a media release from the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency, Helsinki had a greater accumulation of snow last month than as ever been measured for a January. Cold and snow have jammed rail switches that have to then be cleared by hand. \n A listing of cancellations planned for this week in English can be found  here . \n Great free exercise? \n On the subject of cancellations, this could be the time of the year to cancel your gym membership and grab a snow shovel instead. \n Tampere's Aamulehti  takes up the question of whether or not shovelling snow is good for you. To answer that, the paper spoke with exercise physiologist and sports planner  Katriina Ojala  of the UKK Institute Centre for Health Promotion Research. \n Ojala pointed out that to be effective, exercise should be regular. Since snow shovelling is a seasonal activity and not usually done every day, it doesn't stack up against many other routines. \n That's not to say it isn't good for you though. \"When you work at it efficiently, you get a workout for leg and arm muscles and your pulse rises. The heavier the snow, the more muscle work it takes. People who are not in good physical shape get the most health benefits.\" \n There are risks. The cold poses a risk to people with heart problems or asthma. Posture is important to prevent back injuries. \n Ojala's advice is to approach it much like any sport. \n \"Lots of people shovel snow too fast. Just as before any exercise activity, remember to do some warm up before you start.\""}

{"text": "Snow cover averages across many areas of Finland have decreased between the years of 1961-2014, according to a study carried out by researchers at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). \n \"Snow conditions in high‐latitude regions are changing in response to climate warming, and these changes are likely to accelerate as the warming proceeds,\" the report's authors wrote. \n The maximum annual amounts of snow cover in southern and western Finland - and locally in some central areas - have decreased by an average of 2-4 cm every ten years during 1961-2014. \n However, there was no statistically significant change in snow cover amounts in northern Finland during that 53-year period, according to the FMI. \n Researcher  Anna Luomaranta  said maximum snow cover averages measured around 20-40 cm in south-western Finland and more than one metre in Finnish Lapland. \n Snow arrives later, ends earlier \n According to the research, the duration of snow cover also decreased during those five decades. \n Luomaranta said that the snowy season arrived later particularly in central, south-western and western parts of northern Ostrobothnia. \n Snow cover melted earlier especially in western Finland, according to the researcher. \n The disappearance of snow cover took place about four days earlier each decade during that period in western areas, and about one to three days earlier across the rest of the country, according to Luomaranta. \n Major regional differences \n \"Our results indicate that regional differences of changes in snow conditions can be relatively large, even within such a small (region) as Finland,\" according to the study summary. \n The annual maximum snow depth that typically occurs in March was found to have decreased across more than 85 percent of the country, most strongly in western coastal areas. \n In almost half of Finland, this decrease occurred despite an increase in snowy weather, according to the research. \n \"Our findings highlight the complexity of the responses of snow conditions to climatic variability in northern Europe,\" the authors stated. \n The report, \"Snow cover trends in Finland over 1961-2014 based on gridded snow depth observations,\" was published by the  International Journal of Climatology ."}

{"text": "Before 7.00am on Friday, temperatures in Muonio, western Lapland measured -35 degrees Celsius. However by Saturday morning they will reach +five degrees – meaning that conditions in the north will warm up by an astounding 40 degrees overnight. \n However at the same time a weather system will dump freezing rain across the country. According to Yle meteorologist  Matti Huutonen , it is unusual for both phenomena to have such a large-scale effect. He added that there are no records to indicate the last time there was such a radical temperature change in a 24-hour period. \n By 10.00am on Friday, the temperature in Muonio had risen to -17 degrees, already exceeding the usual daytime temperature change. At this time of year, the sun generally causes conditions to warm up by between 10 and 15 degrees. \n Freezing rain causes perilous driving conditions \n The freezing rain expected on Saturday could make road conditions challenging in a zone stretching from Ostrobothnia to western Lapland. Huutonen cautioned motorists to exercise caution on Friday night and Saturday morning. \n Conditions on Saturday will be ideal for taking a turn outdoors as highs will be quite spring-like, rising above freezing throughout the country. \n Huutonen said that the sun’s growing influence will make winter seem a thing of the past as snow cover rapidly shrinks, starting from the west and southwest. \n The Yle meteorologist speculated that in about a week and a half, the snow would likely have melted in a region ranging from Ostrobothnia in the west to Uusimaa in the south."}
{"text": "The Finnish healthcare system is among the best in Europe, says daily  Helsingin Sanomat . Based on a study by Swedish research company Health Powerhouse, Finland ranks sixth among 35 European countries. \n According to HS, the Euro Health Consumer Index commends Finland for its wide range of healthcare services offered at a relatively low price. \n The study compared 48 indicators, including patient rights, access to care and treatment results. In the last category, which measured child mortality, deaths caused by cancer and heart attack and the number of abortions and suicides, Finland fared as well as this year’s winner Switzerland, HS writes. \n There is room for improvement, however, as queues for certain treatments such as cataract surgery are long and the healthcare system does not sufficiently focus on preventative care, the paper says. \n In addition, patients in Finland pay a larger share of prescription drug costs out of their own pocket than in many other European countries, HS writes. After Switzerland, the continent’s best health care is offered in the Netherlands and Norway, the study showed, while Albania, Romania and Hungary hold the bottom spots. \n New Children's Ombudsman \n Tuomas Kurttila  will not serve as Children’s Ombudsman after April, reports daily  Keskisuomalainen . The government will appoint a new ombudsman on Thursday, but Kurttila is not among the possible appointees. \n The Children's Ombudsman monitors the welfare of Finnish children and youth and tries to influence politicians to make decisions that benefit children. \n The position has a five-year term and Kurttila’s term will come to an end this spring. He reapplied for the job while he is also running for Parliament as a Social Democratic Party candidate in the general election. \n On his Facebook page, Kurttila points out that his term has not been without successes. For example, he proposed to the justice ministry that child marriages should be banned. Parliament unanimously  approved the proposal last week . \n Kurttila came under fire  in December following news reports that he had spent more than 5,000 euros on cab rides in three months. He had, for example, taken a 600-euro taxi trip to travel from Oulu to Jyväskylä - a distance of 340 km. \n At the time, Kurttila said his frequent use of cabs was based on time savings concerns, workplace well-being and the conversations he has with taxi drivers. \n Winter returns \n Meanwhile, tabloid  Iltalehti  writes that after a spell of spring weather winter will return with a force on Thursday.

Biting winds will make the situation worse, IL writes. \n “This kind of change in weather is not very exceptional. It just feels that way, because in recent times we have become used to warmer temperatures,” Salminen says. \n What’s more, next week will be even colder and nighttime temperatures could fall to -15 degrees Celsius, including in southern Finland.

By introducing children to foreign languages at an earlier age, the Finnish National Agency for Education wants to make language teaching and choices more equal across the country, HS writes. Currently, teaching of the first foreign language, so called A1-language, begins in third grade. \n About 100 municipalities already took part in a two-year pilot project which was aimed to develop and increase foreign language instruction in daycares, pre- and primary schools. \n \"This project has been very successful,\" says the education ministry's senior ministerial adviser  Minna Polvinen . \n \"According to the feedback we’ve received, this is exactly what language teaching needs,\" she adds. \n One objective of the project has been to diversify language studies, so that as many children as possible would study another language besides English, HS says. \n At the moment, 80 percent of pupils in basic education (grades 1-9) study one foreign language, usually English, in addition to Swedish or Finnish – the country's two official languages. \n The education agency considers the narrowing of language skills among Finns a worrisome trend, according to the paper. \n As a result, besides English, schools in Tampere provide instruction in Swedish, German, French, Russian and Chinese. On top of these, schoolkids in Helsinki can choose Northern Sámi or Estonian, which are both offered in one school. \n Heat wave deaths \n The extended heat wave last summer raised mortality rates among elderly people, writes daily  Karjalainen . Based on a study by the National Institute for Health and Welfare THL, the heatwave during July and August of last year caused the premature deaths of 380 people. \n The daily mortality rate among people aged 65 and over increased by 14 percent, the paper says. \n A long period of high temperatures poses risks to people suffering from heart and circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases, neurological disorders or mental health problems, says  Virpi Kollanus  from THL. \n According to her, mortality increases among older people regardless of whether they live at home or at senior care centres. \n “We recommend that senior care homes improve their preparedness for heat waves,” Kollanus adds. \n The temperature inside senior care homes should not rise beyond 30 degrees Celsius, according to the paper. \n According to figures from the Finnish Meteorological Institute, last summer was two full degrees warmer than the average. In southern Finland, there were 40 days when temperatures exceeded 25 degrees. \n Weekend warmth \n It might not be a heatwave quite yet, but it seems spring is finally on its way. Tabloid  Iltalehti  writes that temperatures in southern and central Finland could top 10 degrees on Friday and Saturday. \n ”Friday in particularly will be fairly dry and sunny aross the country, with the exception of Lapland. In the south, Saturday is a good day to go outdoors as well, with temperatures between five and nine degrees,” says meteorologist  Riikka Lahtinen  from Foreca. \n But strong winds will make the weather feel a bit colder, she notes. \n According to IL, average daytime temperatures in the south have risen above zero degrees, which means that spring has officially stared. \n “Early spring flowers like coltsfoot and hepatica have already been spotted,” Lahtinen says. \n However, nights are likely to remain cold, with temperatures below zero, at least on Wednesday. In Lapland, it could be as cold as -15 degrees, Lahtinen adds."}

{"text": "Police estimated that around 10,000 protesters descended on downtown Helsinki on Saturday to protest the government's inaction over combatting climate change. \n Protesters carried placards and chanted as they made their way through the centre of Helsinki from the Senate Square over to the steps of the Parliament House, starting at 2.00pm. \n Demonstrators called for drastic political measures and structural reforms to ensure that the global mean temperature does not rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius and that consumers do not end up bearing the brunt of the burden for effecting change. \n A crowd of thousands gathered at the Senate Square on Saturday. Timo Jaakonaho / Lehtikuva \n Organisers such as  Katja Hintikainen  said they originally expected between 5,000 and 10,000 protesters. \n \"The next government has to make the right call,\" said fellow organiser  Matti Ikonen  from the \"Irreplaceable\" (Korvaamaton) campaign. \"If we continue to do nothing for another four years I don't know what we'll be able to do.\" \n Concrete measures demanded by the march organisers include halting the sale of petrol-fuelled cars by 2027, defunding power plants that burn fossil fuels and encouraging more plant-oriented food production and consumption by introducing agricultural subsidies and taxes on meat products. \n The climate march was organised by the Korvaamaton campaign, which is backed by groups such as Greenpeace, Bird Life, WWF Finland and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation. \n The first climate march (Ilmastomarssi I) took place in October 2018, when 8,000 people protested decision-makers' inaction on climate issues. \n Change is possible \n Ikonen pointed to the lack of real suggestions for climate measures, despite the fact that Finland and nearly all of its political leaders backed ratification of the Paris Agreement along with the rest of the EU in 2015. \n \"The faster we get some real decisions made, the faster and cheaper it will be to curb global warming,\" Ikonen said. \n Consumers should not be the ones to shoulder the burden of slowing global warming, Ikonen said and he called for legislation to help the public become accustomed to new ways of consuming. \n \"Changes in consumer behaviour can sometimes turn out to be temporary, but it is clear now that people don't want to eat meat or fly in airplanes as much as they used to.\" \n He compared the change in attitude that the campaign represents to the way cigarettes were viewed in the past. In the 1990s smoking was still ubiquitous, but soon social pressure caused the number of smokers to plummet. \n \"When society is ready for change, people often come to accept ideas that they previously resisted. Think about light bulbs: people resisted the EU directive banning incandescent bulbs, but now LED lighting – which uses 99 percent less energy – has become common.\" \n President Halonen stands with young strikers \n Organisers such as Ikonen say the large turnout for the protest represents hope, as does the global  Fridays for Future  campaign.  Schoolchildren around the world  are walking out of school once a week to  protest global climate change . \n On Friday, one day before the large-scale Helsinki demo, some 200 students turned up to protest global warming on the Parliament steps. They were joined by ex-president  Tarja Halonen , who spoke at the rally. \n \"There is no time to stall on climate change. We have to do everything we can, right now,\" Halonen said. \n She also emphasised the meaning of lifelong learning and the importance of voting. \n \"Finland will hold the chair of the European Union starting on 1 July. There are only 5.5 million people in Finland, but other countries will listen to us. It is important as the chairing country to express strong demands that people in Finland support.\""}

But schools and teachers may have different focus points in their teaching, and the issues are not necessarily referred to just as climate change or global warming, but more generally as sustainable lifestyles. \n The OAJ argues that climate change education in Finland should be standardised. \n \"We have to really bring about fact-based, positive changes in attitudes,\" said OAJ chair  Olli Luukkainen . \"Speaking about climate is not fussing, it is crucial. For children to be able to make up their own minds about it, schools must play a big part.\" \n The 'Climate School' project will initially begin in a few select locations, but all schools can register to take part if they want.

Other main beneficiaries have been Canada, Sweden and Russia. \n On the other hand, the report suggests that India's economy would be one third larger if not for the effects of climate change. \n According to the report, \"the primary driver is the parabolic relationship between temperature and economic growth, with warming increasing growth in cool countries and decreasing growth in warm countries\". \n The report's authors add that their results show that, \"in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries’ energy consumption\". \n Marita Laukkanen , chief researcher at Finland's VATT Institute for Economic Research, says she finds the results convincing, but does not see them as reason for Finland to celebrate. \n \"We do not know and cannot completely predict what events or chains of events climate change will trigger,\" Laukkanen tells Yle. She notes that climate change may increase the number of refugees and weaken forest growth, for instance. \n Researchers note that drought is playing an increasing role in migration and unrest, such as in Libya's 2011 revolution and civil war. \n \"We're not all in the same boat\" \n According to the report, \"the primary driver is the parabolic relationship between temperature and economic growth, with warming increasing growth in cool countries and decreasing growth in warm countries\". \n The report's authors add that their results show that, \"in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries’ energy consumption\". \n \"The study shows simply and directly that we're not all in the same boat. The situation has built up historically and some countries are clearly more responsible for this while others have suffered from this and will continue to suffer in the future,\" says  Tero Toivanen  of the University of Helsinki's BIOS Research Unit, which focuses on socio-ecological development issues."}
{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat, the country's most widely-read newspaper, carries a  story  on how the parties chosen by Finland's next likely prime minister, Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne  on Tuesday will have long-ranging consequences for the country's future in terms of its system of social benefits, response to climate change and taxation. Rinne earlier committed himself to reaching a final decision on the parties he will invite to Helsinki's House of the Estates for government formation talks by Tuesday evening. \n The paper writes that \"today is an exciting day in politics\" because the decision the SDP leader makes about what parties to choose will have \"almost as much influence as the election results\", as even some parties that did not do as well in the elections might be chosen to participate in the negotiations. It says that the elections were so close and the field of political parties in Finland preceding the parliamentary elections was so fragmented that \"power is only now being meted out in earnest\". \n Rinne said in a Saturday interview in the paper that he was looking for an \"suitable friend\" from among the parties that had earned the next-best election results: the populist Finns Party, the centre-right National Coalition Party and the Centre Party. \n Shining a light on internet recesses \n The Joensuu-based paper Karjalainen features an  STT story  on cyberbullying, reporting on a recent study that discovered that only one in five parents in Finland knew if their children had been subject to online harassment and only one in four has done anything to prevent their children from being the target of cyberbullying. \n Teachers were found to be much better aware of cyberbullying than parents, with one in three having observed the phenomenon in their work. Both the 1,000-some parents and the over 400 teachers responding to the study's survey said they wished there were more digital tools available to safeguard and promote empathy online. \n Insurance company If's country director  Timo Harju  tells the paper that adult figures in children's lives cannot rely on apps to solve the problem, saying that families should do everything in their power to \"keep the lines of communication open\" and talk about the subject. \n Tracking down lead-foots \n The paper Etelä-Suomen Sanomat also  reports  this Tuesday that police in Finland are planning to start sending notices to Estonian drivers that have been caught speeding by traffic cameras in the country. Law enforcement says the crackdown will begin with Estonian residents because the clear majority of traffic violations by foreigners have been traced to vehicles registered in Estonia. \n The news agency Uutissuomalainen says offenders can expect their first notices in early June. The notice advises the receivers to pick up a ticket stating their fine at the police station in Helsinki's Malmi district. Finnish police cannot send the actual ticket to Estonia, as criminal penalties cannot be sent abroad. \n \"The notice will have a deadline and if the recipient doesn't respond by that time, we can put out a search notice for the individual,\"  Dennis Pasterstein , chief inspector and head of Helsinki Police Department's traffic safety unit, tells the paper. \n Another scorcher in store? \n And finally, the tabloid Iltalehti has the  first of the inevitable summer weather forecasts  that start popping up at this time of the year in Finland. The tabloid reports a prediction from the Weather Company that says that Europe is in for a hotter summer this year than normal. \n Foreca meteorologist  Joanna Rinne  says it is too early to say with any certainty how things will play out, but unseasonably warm temperatures in the south could indicate hotter summer temps are on the way, as southern and central parts of Europe are already heating up. She says Spain could even see the 40 degrees Celsius mark be broken this summer. \n Rinne predicts more high-pressure fronts over northern parts of Europe in the coming months, meaning clear skies. Last summer Finland had 63 days with temperatures over 20 degrees Celsius, the second-warmest summer in Finnish history. The warmest temperature of the season was recorded in the west coast city of Vaasa on 18 July, when the mercury rose to 33.7 degrees. \n The tabloid writes that a Nature Communications study from last August found that extremely high temperatures will be twice as likely in Finland and the rest of the Europe for the next five years due to climate change and a rise in surface temperatures of the planet."}

They are rendered meaningless, even counterproductive, as soon as one nation fails to comply,” he continued. \n Arctic people express concern \n Representatives of indigenous groups at the Arctic Council expressed alarm at the meeting’s failure to result in a final declaration. \n Sámi council president  Åsa Larsson Blind  told delegates, “by mentioning [climate change] by its real name, we can fight it, and reduce its impact.” \n “We need to express our deepest concern about the development of a commitment for this ministerial,” she said. \n James Stotts , president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, said “We believe it’s time to stop bickering over whether there is climate change or not and start implementing strategies and actions to survive climate change.” \n “We believe it’s time to stop hiding from reality,” he concluded."}

A report  released on Thursday by the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, urges Finns to make radical changes to their lifestyles. \n Citing Sitra’s report, HS writes that a person living in Finland negatively impacts the climate five times as much as an individual in India. \n According to Sitra, the gap between Finnish lifestyles and international climate goals is vast. In the next ten years, saying that if the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement are to be achieved, emissions in Finland caused by consumption should be cut by nearly 75 percent. \n Most of the carbon footprint caused by the average person in Finland comes from transportation, housing, as well as food production and consumption. \n But finding solutions to address climate change cannot be the sole responsibility of individuals, as the required changes to address the issue are so great, says  Anu Mänty , senior adviser with Sitra. \n ”Major structural changes are needed. We need to develop new ways of thinking about our economy, infrastructure and consumption-based lifestyles. This requires radical rethinking in politics and administration, as well as in business models and in people’s lives,” she tells HS. \n Better election voter turnout? \n Leading  Tampere daily Aamulehti  suggests that more people in Finland will vote in this year's European Parliamentary elections than five years ago, when less than 40 percent turned out to cast their votes. \n In Pirkanmaa, or the Greater Tampere region surrounding Finland’s second largest city, ”more people are voting than five years ago,” according to Tampere University political researcher  Sami Borg , who was interviewed by Aamulehti. \n Borg forecasts that climate change and immigration will activate people to vote in the MEP elections, especially Greens and Finns Party supporters. \n In Lielahti, Tampere there was a queue of eager voters on Wednesday morning. At the end of that day, 3.6 percent of all eligible Finns had cast their vote; in the Pirkanmaa region that figure stood at 3.9 percent. \n ”On the first day of voting more people voted than [on the first day] five years ago,” Borg told the paper. ”It’s still too early to say whether overall voter turnout will be higher than five years ago.” \n Summer arrives \n Finland’s warmest temperatures of the year were recorded in Turku on Wednesday, writes  tabloid Iltalehti , citing the Finnish Meteorological Institute, which recorded temperatures of 17.5 degrees Celsius in Finland’s third largest city. Espoo was close behind, with 17 degrees Celsius recorded on Wednesday. \n Institute meteorologist  Tomi Kaurinen  told Iltalehti that ”temperatures will continue to heat up and could climb above 20 degrees Celsius in the next couple of days.” \n According to Iltalehti, Thursday will be sunny and clear throughout the country, with highs of 17 degrees Celsius expected in the capital region and slightly cooler temperatures for coastal areas. \n ”Even northern regions will hit 15 degrees Celsius, and Lapland will see temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius,” Kaurinen told Iltalehti."}

Interrail passes enable cross-European travel during a set period of time and are valid on most trains across the continent. \n HS interviews Helsinki-based journalist  Heidi Kalmari , who says she seriously started to consider sustainability issues many years ago while working with another writer on a book about ecological travel. \n “Since then I have tried my best to avoid flying for leisure,” Kalmari tells the paper. “It seems as though many people just fly to European destinations for the weekend because it’s so cheap, for instance as a way to cheer oneself up after a hectic stretch of work. But it’s not very sustainable,” she adds. \n On Monday Kalmari starts her summer holiday with an Interrail trip headed via Stockholm, Hamburg, and Rostock to Berlin with her husband and two children, aged 8 and 10. \n According to HS, Kalmari is one of a growing number of people concerned about climate change who are using alternative forms of transport for travel. State-owned railways VR reports that Interrail pass sales grew 20 percent in January-February alone. This compares to about 6 percent growth for the same time period the previous year. Figures for March onward are not yet available, but it’s very likely that Interrail pass sales will increase in the run-up to summer, says HS. \n VR’s  Salla Ketola , vice president of sales and customer experience, tells HS that she estimates this year more than 7,000 Interrail Passes will be sold, which will break records of previous years. It is, however, still far from the Interrail heyday figures -- in 1986, 20,000 Interrail passes for European trips were sold in Finland. \n HS also goes onto compare the cost, time and CO2 emissions of different of trips such as Helsinki to Berlin. By flying, the trip takes about a little more than two hours and costs 52 euros whereas by boat and train the journey takes just over 32 hours and costs 311 euros. \n Carbon emissions per person for the Helsinki-Berlin flight are 118.6 while for the same trip they are 70.2 by boat and 29.5 by train. \n Celebrating diversity \n Some Helsinki taxis will be wrapped in multi-coloured tape to mark Helsinki Pride week, which begins on Monday writes tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat . This theme of this year’s pride festival is ' ääni ,' (voice in English), which aims to highlight minority rights and attempts to provide a forum for those many voices that are often left unheard. \n One of the week's events includes a panel discussion organised by THL, the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare, that will examine whether minority voices are heard in research and surveys compiled by statisticians, writes the tabloid. \n Last year Helsinki Pride drew more than 100,000 people to the annual festival and parade. This year's parade will be held on Saturday. Many other cities and communities are also holding Pride events across the country. \n Stormy weather in store \n Tabloid  Iltalehti  warns readers that heavy rain showers are in store for all of Finland on Wednesday.

So far this summer's weather has offered ideal growing conditions, so producers expect a large, high-quality crop of the berries, which are considered an  emblem of the Finnish summer . \n ProAgria says that strawberries are very sweet this summer thanks to the sunny weather and temperature variations. However significant rainfall is needed in southern Finland to ensure a good harvest, as plants have begun to suffer from dryness. \n New potatoes at their best \n Farmers in the south and along the southwestern coast are now gathering strawberries grown under nets or fabric, while open-air berries will soon be ready for picking. \n Strawberry harvesting is also getting underway this week in other parts of southern and central Finland. The main harvest is expected to begin in earnest during the first week of July. \n Harvesting conditions for new potatoes and other early vegetables are also reaching their best. In general, crops in southern Finland are more than a week ahead of the average schedule, with those in the east and north on a normal timetable."}
{"text": "As most of the rest of Europe suffers record heat, Finland's weather is quite different. On Saturday, wet snow fell around 4 pm in the village of Kilpisjärvi. It's located in the municipality of Enontekiö at the top of Finnish Lapland's northwestern arm, close to the borders with Norway and Sweden. \n There was little accumulation from the flurry, which was recorded by a traffic camera on European route E8, a road that extends from Turku, southwest Finland, up to Tromsø, northern Norway, also known as the Four Winds' Road. Near the village, the route reaches an elevation of 565.8 metres, the highest point in the Finnish road system. \n Yle meteorologist  Matti Huutonen  says that sleet or snow is not uncommon in the far north-west of the country during the summer, falling about once a month on average. \n \"Kilpisjärvi is so high up, right next to the Norwegian mountains, that cold air comes down from the Arctic Sea, which sometimes condenses and falls as snow or sleet,\" he explains. \n Kilpisjärvi's daily mean temperature in June is 7.5 degrees Celsius. From October through April, the mean temperature remains below freezing. \n Huutonen says that unsettled, cool weather is in store for Lapland this week, so hikers and campers should prepare for all kinds of conditions. \n -2.4 C in Jyväskylä \n The chilly weather is not restricted to Finnish Lapland. There was frost early Saturday as far south as Jyväskylä where the temperature sank to -2.4, the same as in Kainuu. Meanwhile Salla, eastern Lapland, reported readings of -2.9. \n Warmer weather is set to flow into southern Finland on Monday, with temperatures expected to reach the 25-degree mark in the southeast. Nights may be uncomfortably warm and humid. \n The northwestern arm will however remain wet and chilly, with temperatures remaining in the single digits. \n On Friday, France reached its highest recorded temperature ever, 45.9 degrees Celsius. At least six deaths in southern Europe have been attributed to the heatwave."}

Local resident  Janna Airas  recorded the wild weather for posterity. \n According to Yle meteorologist  Matti Huutonen , the seemingly unseasonal weather was not at all unusual. He noted that thunderstorms and hail often go together. \n \"There are always hailstones in thunderclouds. Now they have been so large, that they have not had time to melt before hitting the ground,\" he explained. \n While yesterday’s thundery weather in the southeast has now migrated toward Russia, a new low-pressure zone moved over the west on Monday night, bringing more thunderstorms across the country. However Huutonen said that he did not expect more hail. \n Finnish news agency STT reported that Monday’s wild weather resulted in many calls for emergency service workers in Lappeenranta, as residents struggled to repair damage caused by the hail. \n Lightning strikes hit buildings, one person \n In Koli, eastern Finland, rescue services were also put to the test during violent thundershowers that plagued the region on Monday evening. \n Lightning strikes started a fire at an old school building at Niinilahdentie. The building, which was being used for accommodation, held 14 people at the time, however no one was reported injured. \n Meanwhile another explosive lightning bolt struck an oil container igniting a fire that spread to the cellar of a building on the property and badly damaged the structure. Other parts of the building that were used for residential purposes were spared from serious damage. Work continued late into the night to extinguish the blaze and residents were evacuated. \n Lightning also struck and mildly injured one individual in the Mäkränaho outdoor area. The patient was taken to the North Karelia central hospital for treatment. Meanwhile the electrical discharges also set a small cottage on fire on an island in the Koli region, completely destroying the structure.

The group said that the last time that Finland had seen as many drownings in June was during a heatwave in 2013. \n The group said that far too often, people head onto the water when they're drinking alcohol and don't use life preservers, saying that half of last month's drowning victims had been intoxicated. \n \"A large number of these drownings could have been avoided if people used the proper life jackets, took the weather into account and otherwise be aware of the risks of being on the water,\" FSL communications specialist  Niko Nieminen  said. \n Five of the victims had drowned during the long Midsummer holiday weekend, and at least 15 of all of the victims were male, according to the FSL. \n Nine of the drowning occurred as the victims were swimming, five drowned in boating incidents and one had fallen into the water. The circumstances of the remaining five vicitms remained unclear, the federation said on Thursday. \n According to preliminary statistics, a total of 44 people drowned during the first half of this year. \n In June of last year, nine people drowned and the total number of drowning victims during the first half of 2018 was 28."}
{"text": "The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry  announced on Thursday  that it would redouble its efforts to protect the endangered Saimaa ringed seal after  reports of dead pups  arose earlier in the week. \n Daily  Aamulehti wrote  that the ministry will establish a new working group in August to step up protection for the animal, which is unique to Finland's Saimaa lake system. The ministry said the group intends to deliver a plan to survey and restrict fishing activities in the ringed seal's habitat by 2021, when the current restriction expires. \n An annual springtime ban on net fishing in the heartland of  the endangered species  begins on 15 April and is lifted on the last day of June. According to AL the corpses of four Saimaa ringed seal pups were found tangled in fishing nets in early July, one week after this year's prohibition ended. \n \"This is extremely sad,\" Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson  Jari Leppä  told AL. \"None of us wants to see any more dead pups.\" \n Ordinary citizens have reacted to the seal deaths by pushing for a year-round ban on the use of fishing nets in seal habitats. In just two days (at time of writing) more than 37,000 people had signed a  citizens' initiative to completely outlaw net fishing  in such regions. Legal reforms introduced in 2011 require Finland's Parliament to consider initiatives with at least 50,000 signatures. \n Bare naked ladies against body shaming \n In other activist news,  tabloid Iltalehti  covers a form of civil protest that is still new to Finland: a bare-chested flash mob of women and men demanding that everyone should have the right to walk around topless in public. \n The prime movers of the first such demonstration in early June,  Säde Vallaren  and  Sandra Marins , announced that the second ever Finnish \"boob flash mob\" will be organised at the Hietaniemi beach on Saturday. \n Both activists said in IL that the first ever such flash mob at the same location was \"empowering, calm, beautiful and sisterly\". \n \"There was an almost magical atmosphere,\" said Marins. \"It was amazing to see the range of emotions people were experiencing.\" \n Vallaren said that even though both organisers have received trolling messages and threats, no counter-protesters were to be seen at the beach demo. Police, too, were briefly on site but did not intervene, according to IL. \n The paper also mentions blogger  Emilia Huttunen , who made international headlines by posting a social media photo of herself naked, but with her husband's nipples edited over the image in a bid to bypass the censorship of online platforms. \n Vallaren and Marins said that after Saturday the next flash mob could take place at the Helsinki Central Railway Station, an environment they say may turn out to be very different to the warmth of sandy Hietaniemi. Both said their work to quell the \"shock value\" of women's bodies has only just begun. \n \"We won't stop until people are no longer upset by a woman's naked breasts,\" they said. \n Finland getting \"unlucky\" weather \n Beaches in southern Finland will likely stay quite empty over the weekend, as the weather takes a wet and dramatic turn. \n Daily Helsingin Sanomat  wrote that two fronts of warm air will bypass Finland, causing temperature dips and dozens of millimetres of torrential rainfall. \n \"Some regions may experience a full month's rain in just this one weekend,\" Foreca meteorologist  Markus Mäntykangas  told HS. \n He said that such fluctuations are common in Finland's brief summer months. The current cold slump may last for another week, but Mäntykangas said the return of warmer conditions are just a matter of time. \n \"People in Finland are unlucky right now. There's time still for sweltering days all the way into September.\""}
{"text": "No new wind energy farms have begun operations in Finland since 2017, yet the amount of electricity produced with the wind has risen briskly over the past year, the Uutissuomalainen newspaper group reports on Friday. \n The industry group Finnish Energy says that wind power production rose by almost 30 percent between May 2018 and May this year. That output is set to rise as a number of new wind turbines are currently being built in Finland. \n Production subsidies are only granted to wind farms that began producing electricity by the end of 2017. However wind energy is no longer dependent on subsidies for financially viability. \n \"Production costs have dropped so sharply that a lot of wind power capacity is being installed without subsidies,\" says  Anna Mikkonen , CEO of the Finnish Wind Power Association (FWPA). She points out that some of the turbines that became eligible for subsidies as they were completed by the end of 2017 did not actually get up to full output until sometime last year. \n The trade body's figures show that cumulative installed wind energy capacity has risen from nearly nothing a decade ago to 500 megawatts (MW) in 2013, then surpassing 2,000 MW last year. That is still far behind neighbouring Sweden, which had more than 7,500 MW installed by the end of last year, according to Wind Power Monthly. \n The number of installed turbines has climbed from just over 100 in 2009 to 700 last year. Their average size has also increased steadily, now around 3 MW each. The heaviest concentration of turbines is in North Ostrobothnia in western Finland, which accounts for 42 percent of all capacity. The municipalities of Kalajoki and Raahe are hotbeds of wind power, with nearly 400 MW of capacity between them. \n As of the end of last year, wind power accounted for 6.7 percent of Finland's electricity consumption. \n Climate change brings brisker breezes \n The  Finnish Wind Atlas  site, established by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), notes that average wind speeds in Finland are gradually rising as a result of climate change. Meteorologists and those in the wind power sector agree that the past year has been windier than the year before. \n For instance, in February the weather station at Helsinki Airport recorded average winds of 5.9 metres per second, compared to the long-term average of 4.1 m/s. In June the corresponding figures were 4.9 and 3.8 m/s. The winter months tend to be windier than summer in Finland. \n \"When the weather is dominated by low-pressure systems, the average wind speed is normally higher than in high-pressure conditions,\" explains FMI meteorologist  Niina Niinimäki . \n At the start of this year, the FMI clocked the  highest wind speed ever recorded  in Finland, 32.5 m/s. It was tracked on 2 January at Bogskär, just off the island of Kökar in the maritime province of Åland between mainland Finland and Sweden. That was just under the hurricane level of 33 m/s. \n Sometimes gales can be too much of a good thing for wind turbines. When winds begin to approach 30 m/s, most wind park operators phase turbines out of use in order to prevent damage. However this has rarely been necessary in Finland."}

{"text": "Halfway through the month, temperatures during July have stubbornly remained more than three degrees Celsius below long-term averages. Visitors and residents alike have likely noticed Finland's wet, chilly weather, particularly compared to last summer. \n \"This can safely be called an unusually cold start to July,\" said  Niina Niinimäki  from the Finnish Meteorological Society (FMI). \n July has been  unusually cool , with highs barely reaching 20 degrees Celsius. \n July of last year saw the  highest-ever temperatures recorded  by the FMI. Midway through the month, weather stations were regularly reporting temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius across much of the country. \n However, some say there are a number of positive aspects to the current chill Finland is experiencing. \n Exercise, training easier \n Those who enjoy regular exercise, like endurance athletes, get more out of their training sessions when it isn't sweltering hot. \n Cross-country ski coach for the Finnish national team  Ville Oksanen  said that heart rates tend to spike when it's too warm. \n While Central European skiers are forced to hit the track in blistering heat, Finland's female skiers are able to train in the brisk air of Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland, where temperatures hovered around 16 degrees on Monday. \n Story continues after photo. \n Women's national cross-country skiing team coach Ville Oksanen. Anu Karttunen / Yle \n \"It's been way too warm in Central Europe these days, it might affect the training regimen,\" said Oksanen. \"Although they do have mountains where they can train in cooler environments.\" \n On the other hand Oksanen said he prefers \"summer to be summer\" and that he likes cold winters, too. \n Lower heatstroke risk \n The chilly summer has also been a relief to many pensioners and chronically ill patients. Excessive heat doesn't just make things uncomfortable for seniors, it can be life-threatening. Last summer,  when temperatures were far higher , nearly 400 heatstroke-related deaths, mostly of the elderly, were reported across the country. \n Cousins  Toini Inkeröinen , 90, and  Elsa Kiviniemi , 93, said they were enjoying the this summer's cool temperatures in Rovaniemi. \n \"You get dizzy and sweaty and you're too tired to do anything,\" Kiviniemi explained. \n Story continues after photo. \n The elderly face serious health risks when it gets hot. Pixabay \n Now, with the lower temperatures, the elderly and others sensitive to the heat can freely enjoy simple activities like taking walks outdoors. \n \"There's a nice little jogging track that the city built for us old folks,\" said Inkeröinen. \"It's only 300-400 metres long. Sometimes we walk farther and have a rest on the bus station benches.\" \n Cows produce more milk \n High heat is also no friend of domestic animals. A year ago the heat wave forced some dog-owners to walk their canines at night, after the air and asphalt had cooled down. \n Cattle also do better in cool conditions; cows produce 10-15 percent more milk when it's cool outside, according to Rovaniemi farmer  Matti Pöykkö. \n Story continues after photo. \n Research cows in Minkiö, Jokioinen. Riitta Tapiomäki / Yle \n \"I'd say about 10 degrees Celsius is optimal for a cow,\" Pöykkö said. \"When it's hot they stay inside in the shade and try not to move or eat much.\" \n In fact, Pöykkö said the summer has been unusually good to him. \n \"There'll be so much to harvest that I wonder if I'll get to it all. Which is great after a few more difficult years. But I do wish us humans could get some heat after enduring the long winter.\""}

Respondents were allowed to name three people. \n HS says it wasn’t surprising that the list was topped by politicians, especially those who have recently been in the headlines. The most disliked on the list were former PM  Juha Sipilä  (Centre Party), current prime minister  Antti Rinne  (Social Democratic Party), and Finns Party leader  Jussi Halla-aho . \n Kone’s biggest deal ever \n Financial newspaper  Taloussanomat  reports that Finland-based global elevator firm Kone is reportedly considering a 16 billion euro business deal, which according to an analyst would be the most significant deal the firm has ever made. \n Taloussanomat writes that German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp is said to be preparing to sell off its elevator business, as was reported earlier in July, and that one of the purchaser candidates is Kone. Kone has not commented on the rumours. \n According to Taloussanomat, if Kone does acquire Thyssenkrupp’s elevator business, it would be one of the largest business deals in Finnish business history. \n All up to Barry \n Tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  reports that Hurricane Barry holds the key to what type of weather Finland will have for the rest of the summer: Will warm, sunny weather return or will cooler temperatures prevail? \n All of Europe is dependent on Barry, which has raged over the western states in the US and is currently gathering strength in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, the powerful storm is moving through the northern parts of the US towards the Atlantic. \n “The hurricane will likely shake up the world’s greater weather picture. Next week may bring weather surprises,” predicts Foreca meteorologist  Jenna Salminen  in an interview with the tabloid. \n Europe may also see another heatwave as the Mediterranean and central Europe are forecast to receive another heatwave with more than 40-degree Celsius temperatures like those the region saw in June. \n So, far Finland has not been embraced by the sizzling temperatures this summer, and not long ago it seemed that the small Nordic country would not be affected by the hot temperatures. However, that looks set to change. \n “Now it looks as though the heatwave will also stretch into Finland,” Salminen tells the paper, saying it will bring warm, humid weather and thunderstorms."}

Then they could negotiate and see how the matter is handled, and whether something can be done about the heat,\" Kokki said. \n In the longer term, Kokki said that landlords will likely begin to offer air conditioners as part of rental agreements in the homes they rent out. \n According to Finnish law, the maximum temperature a residential dwelling is permitted to reach is 32 degrees Celsius.

Rovaniemi basked in 30 degree temperatures on Saturday, but on Monday, a high of only 11 degrees Celsius is predicted. \n This past weekend Finland got a taste of the hot conditions Europe and the US have been enduring this summer, although the \"record temperatures\" charted on Sunday in the south still look small compared to heatwaves exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in Paris and New York. \n The Finnish Meteorological Institute tweeted that historic heat records were set on Sunday at measurement stations in Helsinki's Kaisaniemi, the cities of Kaarina, Salo, Lohja and the Åland Islands. \n IL reports that the summer's hottest temperature to date – 33.7 degrees Celsius – was also measured in Finland's southern city of Porvoo. \n Today marks 2019's Earth Overshoot Day  \n The Jyväskylä paper Keskisuomalainen  reports  on  Earth Overshoot Day , the day when humanity’s demand for ecological resources and services in a given year exceeds what Earth can regenerate in that year. \n This year the world reached its overshoot day today – 29 July – two days earlier than last year. The paper reports that  Finland already exceeded its share of the Earth's natural resources in early April . At the time, the WWF said the world would need 3.8 planets if everyone in the world consumed resources at the rate Finns do. \n Finland  hosted an informal meeting of EU environment and climate ministers in mid-July that focused on expanding the circular economy to mitigate climate change and halt the loss of biodiversity. The paper cites a Ministry of the Environment press release from today that says quickly cutting down on consumption is the only solution. The Ministry points out that of the 80 billion tones of natural resources that the population consumes each year, only nine percent is reused or recycled. \n Fast-forward heating in the Gulf of Bothnia \n In a similar vein, the country's most widely-read daily Helsingin Sanomat carries a story on how  climate change is projected to warm up the Gulf of Bothnia faster than the rest of the Baltic Sea . \n Among other things, HS ponders how increasing temperatures in the waters that separate Finland and Sweden will affect the area's shipping and fish farming industries, wind power projects, coastal residences and tourism. \n Markku Viitasalo  from the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) is part of a six-year  SmartSea  research project that includes 40 researchers from Finland and Sweden studying sustainable use of the Finland’s marine resources. \n \"The Baltic Sea is like a miniature model, compared to the big oceans, so everything happens faster and more dramatically there. This is why it's a good research topic for analyzing the shape and dynamics of the changes,\" Viitasalo tells HS. \n He further informs the paper that climate change will bring more rain, which will further dilute the saline content of the Baltic. This will change the fauna and flora of the sea, prompting some native species to move farther north and allow invasive species to move in. \n Putin floats off the western coast \n Other news from the Baltic Sea comes from Russia today, as the state news agency TASS  reports  that Russian President  Vladimir Putin  dove to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland this weekend in a bathyscaphe (self-propelled submersible). The Russian leader inspected the remains of a Shch-308 Semga submarine that sank off the Finnish island of Utö during WWII.

Food waste is no small matter, points out the report. \n Globally, food waste is estimated to be at 1.3 billion tonnes a year. \n Domestic figures \n In Finland, six percent of food purchased for home consumption ends up as waste. \n All told, Finnish households throw out 120 to 160 million kilos of food annually, which places a burden on both the production chain and the waste chain. \n For Europeans and North Americans, the typical average is 95 to 115 kilos a year. In Asia and Africa that figure is 6 to 11 kilos. \n The food chain accounts for more than a quarter of global warming greenhouse gas emissions, while one third of primary production ends up being wasted, the report concludes."}

And we only had two people in the department who ever opened them,\" commissioner  Sari Sarani  of the police's cybercrimes unit told HS. \n However, according to Sarani, the police's practices for recording warnings about the targeting of children online has now changed, with more staff than ever currently handling on the reports and investigating of such cases. \n Sarani also told HS that the police urge the public's assistance in tackling sexual crimes against children. \n Location of slot machines under review \n Tabloid Iltalehti reports on the decision by Finland's gaming monopoly Veikkaus to \"quietly\"  remove eight slot machines from sites  which may have been deemed inappropriate. \n The gambling firm has been under considerable pressure recently to review the location of some of its machines, as a citizens' initiative calling for their removal from shops and kiosks has now  garnered more than 25,000 signatures . \n According to IL, some of the vending machines which have now been removed were located in shops or cafes connected to hospitals and rehabilitation centres. The tabloid, in a previous report, had raised concerns that certain medication may contribute to gambling addiction. \n Marko Peltokorpi , director of sales at Veikkaus, told IL that the firm is reviewing the practice of placing slot machines near to hospitals, health clinics and rehabilitation centres. \n \"Veikkaus' point of sale criteria states that slot machines should not be placed in premises where the clientele consists mainly of minors,\" Peltokorpi told the tabloid. \"This paragraph has now been interpreted as also extending to locations whose main clientele consists of the sick and elderly.\" \n Here comes the sun \n HS's sister tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reports that the recent turbulent weather is expected to  take a turn for the better , as a high pressure system will bring the sun back to Finland this weekend. \n \"The eastern part of the country will be largely clear and sunny on Saturday,\"  Iiris Viljamaa , a meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute tells IS. \"Temperatures should rise to at least 23-24 degrees Celsius.\" \n Central and southern areas can also expect similar conditions, according to Viljamaa, and she advises people to make the most of the mellow conditions while they lasts. \n Immediately after the weekend, the wind, rain and unstable weather will return to Finland. \n Therefore, the tabloid advises, this weekend is an ideal time to start picking mushrooms and berries in the rain-soaked forest, or even just to get outside and enjoy the sunshine, as it may be the last opportunity to do so this summer."}

In recent months, passengers have made numerous complaints about unclean cabins, posting pictures of untidy play areas and filthy floors on social media including VR’s Facebook community page. \n HS interviews commuter  Liisa Lesonen , who traveled from Helsinki to Vaasa in the business cabin of an InterCity train last Saturday. According to Lesonen, the train’s floor was dusty and muddy. \n \"There was all kinds of garbage under the benches and the train’s bathroom smelled terrible, even from a few metres away,\" Lesonen told the paper. \"Their train compartments used to be much cleaner. These days I don’t even want to put my bag on the floor,\" she said. \n After VR put their cleaning contract up for competitive tender, the job of keeping the fleet neat went from contractor SOL to RTK in June. \n At the time, VR’s operative director  Vesa Pippuri  told HS that there had been some challenges with the transition of service providers, but that they were working to smooth things out. \n However, more than a month on, there is little improvement in the situation, writes HS. Among the issues, customers have been dismayed about the state of the morning’s first trains, which are so dirty that it appears they haven't been cleaned. \n Unexpected discovery  \n Ilta-Sanomat (IS) , the sister tabloid of HS, reports that a body was discovered on Thursday on the roof of a train in Vantaa, just north of Helsinki. \n Around 6 pm, train traffic was halted at the Louhela station. The rescue department told IS that a body was spotted atop a train at the station. \n \"The rescue department went to retrieve the body and found that the person had passed away,\"  Raimo Laakso , the fire chief on duty told IS.

{"text": "A Porvoo hotel served as a month-long base camp for the pair of brothers suspected of  opening fire on two police officers  in the southern Finland town last weekend,  writes daily Helsingin Sanomat . Like other local news media, HS devotes considerable real estate to opening up the background to the shooting late Saturday night that left two officers injured, with one still in hospital. \n The largest-circulation daily reports that police used a saw on the door of the brothers' motel room as they continued gathering evidence for what authorities are investigating as attempted murder. HS says that according to information it received, the men, aged 25 and 30, previously claimed that they were working at a local construction site, while one local with whom they interacted said they understood that the men were working \"off the books\". \n The motel was about one kilometre from the site of the shooting incident. Other residents told HS that the men did not cause any trouble before Saturday night and that their Volvo estate wagon had become a familiar sight in the area. \n The owner of a wholesale business opposite the scene of the shooting,  Markus Lahtela , said he had seen two \"mean-looking\" men walking along the roadside on Saturday night. He described the duo as \"the type I wouldn’t want to meet in an alley\". He later recognised them in the news after they had been detained. Lahtela also told HS that there had been a series of petty crimes in the area of late – not burglaries, but minor cases of larceny. \n Childhood spent in Porvoo \n HS journalists did some traditional gumshoe work and  interviewed locals for a profile of the brothers , who were said to have grown up in Porvoo before moving to Sweden when the elder brother was in eighth grade. The paper learned that the older brother had competed in mixed martial arts fights in Sweden. \n The older brother's acquaintances included several Finns, some of whom live in the Itä-Uusimaa region of southern Finland. \"At first I was a bit shocked when I heard about it,\" said one source who last met the brothers about 10 years ago. \n \"Maybe they were a bit wild, but then we all were,\" the person told HS. \n Another interviewee said that as a student, the older brother was known to be a shoplifter. That person claimed to have last seen one of the men about a year ago. The source described the older man as a petty crook with ties to criminal circles in Sweden and said they were not surprised to hear that the older brother is suspected to have been involved in Saturday night’s daring crime. \n Swedish paper's ambush theory \n Meanwhile tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat reports  that the older suspect apparently had no criminal background in Finland but had been under scrutiny for tax and accounting offences in Sweden three years ago. \n IS is one of the local papers that links to  Swedish evening paper Expressen , which carries a story alleging that the men were the ones who placed a call to local emergency services on Saturday night to lure police to the Ölstens industrial area in western Porvoo. Once police were on the way, they laid in wait to ambush the unsuspecting patrol unit. \n IS also references the online service of  commercial broadcaster MTV , which claims that the suspects made off with one of the injured officers' firearms. The broadcaster notes that lead investigator  Kimmo Huhta-aho  of the National Bureau of Investigation did not comment on the assertion when interviewed on Monday night. \n Changing climate and longer summers \n Tuesday’s papers also find time to focus on another pet subject in Finland – the weather. Tabloid daily  Iltalehti reports that  daytime highs reached 25.1 degrees Celsius in the Åland Islands on Monday. In Finland, 25 degrees represents  a symbolic \"heat threshold\"  when locals consider the weather to be officially \"hot\". \n \"A warm air mass is linked to a high pressure [zone] and when the sun is blazing in the sky, temperatures will rise,\" Foreca meteorologist  Kristian Roine  explained to IL, adding that the next three days will likely see highs rise above 25 degrees. \n By Friday, precipitation could have a cooling effect, however conditions could heat up again over the weekend with the warm weather extending into next week. \n According to the meteorologist, Finland is seeing the effects of climate change. \"Heat records have been broken every year since 2010. Climate change has been real over the past 20 years or so,\" he added. \n The last time Finland saw a balmy end to summer was in 2002. Back then temperatures exceeded 25 degrees in two locations on 3 September. The highest temperatures were 25.4 degrees recorded in Mietoinen in western Finland and 25.1 degrees in Anjalankoski in southeast Finland’s Kymenlaakso region."}

{"text": "Horticulturist  Arno Kasvi  marvels at a peach tree growing in Ruissalo, part of the southwestern city of Turku. The tree, which has flourished on a shady slope in the centre of the garden, was a gift and is already 10 years old. Kasvi has been following the stages of the tree’s annual growth cycle. \n \"The tree has not really been cared for, but it still produces an edible harvest. It grows best in the shade. The problem with growing peaches in Finland is that they begin blooming too early in the year, for example on the walls of houses, even in January. At that time of the year, there are no pollinators around,\" said Kasvi. \n Story continues after photo. \n Peaches in a Finnish garden. Minna Rosvall / Yle \n Peach trees are not usually covered in a protective blanket in winter, nor are they shielded from the sunlight. This particular tree’s health demonstrates the effect of climate change on home gardens. \n \"If the tree is cared for, it would yield a more regular harvest. The amount of produce has varied in recent years. Sometimes the peaches come in bucketfuls, like this summer, and other times there are distinctly less,\" said Kasvi. \n Worth trying exotic varieties \n The Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) is carrying out extensive research into how climate change is affecting the country. The institute predicts that the temperature will rise by two to seven degrees Celsius while rainfall will increase by six to 20 percent by 2080. \n Saila Karhu , a research professor at the institute, unveils a steadily growing grapevine outside its Piikkiö office. \n \"There was a building here earlier, and the vine would grow on its outer wall. The building has been demolished, but the grapes continue to grow at a steady rate. It’s surprising that authentic varieties of grapes that thrive in Finland have been found, including varieties that can be eaten and used to make wine,\" she added. \n Story continues after photo. \n A flourishing grapevine in Piikiö. Minna Rosvall / Yle \n Karhu notes that this too is a result of climate change. She expressed astonishment at peaches and apricots not only being able to withstand the Finnish winter but being harvested regularly. \n \"Sweet cherries could become a new crop, and the commercial cultivation of pears will likely increase significantly. The production area of apples, in turn, will be extended towards the North,\" she said. \n Karhu suggests growing exotic varieties of fruit in home gardens, but she does not recommend cultivating them for commercial purposes. She points out that it is easier to grow annual plants, as you need not worry about them surviving the winters. \n Warm winters and quickly melting snow aid plant growth \n A magnolia that bloomed last spring outside the institute’s Piikiö office is still flourishing. The beech tree, which was planted in the 1930s, has begun sprouting germinated seeds and reproducing for the first time ever in the past few years. \n \"Climate change has led to a prolonged growing season, with less snow, and snow melting earlier in the spring. Very cold winter seasons are also expected to decrease, as will their likelihood. This will promote the protection of more delicate plants,\" said Karhu. \n Story continues after photo. \n Seeds from a beech tree in Piikkiö. Minna Rosvall / Yle \n Additionally, autumn weather will be milder for longer, but it will also be very wet and rainy. This could adversely affect plant dormancy in winter. \n \"If autumn is fairly warm and long, the plants are in a good position to prepare for winter, and it aids their dormancy,\" Karhu said. \n Eggplant and corn crops thriving \n Kasvi encourages fruit cultivators to experiment. He displays eggplants growing in a bed at the University of Turku's botanical garden. \n \"Eggplants thrive in greenhouses in Finland, but these demonstrate that they flourish in the open as well,\" Kasvi said. \n He then quickly switched to the topic of corn and quinoa. \n \"Quinoa, like corn, is an Incan grain from South America. Corn is maturing at a high rate right now. The amount of heat is good, as April and May were exceptionally hot and there were no frosty nights. If horticulturists or farmers do not succeed this summer, they should change their fields,\" Kasvi said. \n Story continues after photo.  \n . \n Corn cultivators need not worry about the crop surviving winter. Minna Rosvall / Yle \n He emphasises that using the same plot of land for several years lets you gain agricultural and horticultural experience, and proposes growing different varieties. \n \"There are varieties of maize that are easy to cultivate, but I only recommend growing peach trees as a hobby. It is a high maintenance crop compared to corn, for example.\" Kasvi said, also highlighting the limited yield. \"It should be remembered that peach trees bloom as rarely as plum trees. They also need to be pruned, as the tree could crack under the weight of an abundant yield.\""}
{"text": "Meteorologists have said that there is a high possibility for skywatchers to witness a display of Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights on Saturday or Sunday night. \n The event is caused by a rapid electromagnetic discharge from an opening in the Sun’s corona towards the earth. According to forecasts by the Finnish Meteorological Institute FMI, the speed of the discharge could exceed 700 kilometres per second and could trigger a minor magnetic storm. \n \"Things are happening in space! In the nights ahead it’s possible that we will see Northern Lights in our skies,\" FMI tweeted on Saturday afternoon. \n It added that if the storm is even a bit more powerful, then the phenomenon known as Aurora Borealis could be visible as far as southern Finland around midnight on Saturday. \n FMI: Uncertainty over timing \n FMI said the biggest uncertainty about its space weather forecast is in the timing. \"If the impact of the opening in the corona is the same as last time [on 5 August] it will begin in Sunday, in which case the Northern Lights show will begin Sunday night,\" the agency said on its website. \n \"However the opening has expanded since the last time so this time the discharge could arrive earlier, in other words on Saturday night,\" it added, advising the public to monitor the situation from Saturday evening. \n \"If nothing happens then, you should check again on Sunday night,\" FMI continued. It’s also possible to follow the agency’s online  space weather forecast in English , however  the Finnish-language service provides more information . \n \"In terms of [expected] cloud cover there is a good chance to see the Northern Lights, at least in southern and central Finland.

{"text": "With warm weather continuing in early September, this summer has brought more hot days than usual to most of the country, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). It defines \"hot\" as 25 degrees Celsius (77F) or more. \n That imaginary barrier was breached again on Monday when thermometers in the northern city of Oulu reached 25.4 C. \n In western Finland the June-August period was mostly about one degree warmer than the long-term average. Meanwhile along the eastern border and the far north, the average was about a degree below usual. \n Starting in May, the place with the most hot days was the southern town of Hattula, near Hämeenlinna. It clocked up 26 days of 25C or more. Meanwhile Kilpisjärvi in the far northwestern arm, has not reached 25 at all this year. \n Monday was the 37th day this year when the mercury reached 25 somewhere in the country. That is two more than the long-term average. \n Late heat in Lapland \n Late August brought a new heatwave to northern Finland. On 29 August it pushed the thermometer to 25.3 degrees in Rovaniemi, capital of Finnish Lapland. According to the FMI, that is the latest recorded date that the mercury has ever surpassed 25C in Finnish Lapland. \n August was drier than usual through most of the country. In general rainfall was less than the normal level. Much of central Finland, Savo and North Karelia had their driest summer since 1955. \n Despite the drought, torrential downpours caused material damage in Pori on 8 August and in Helsinki on 23 August. \n Statistically, the temperature usually breaks the 25C barrier on one day in September. This year it already has on the first two days of the month, notes Yle meteorologist  Anne Borgström . \n She predicts unstable conditions for the rest of the week, with temperatures declining to more seasonable levels. Southern Finland, for instance, should mostly have highs of 16-18C over the next week, while Oulu's highs will hover around 14-15 and Rovaniemi slightly below that."}
{"text": "As showers and thunderstorms move across the southwest, the crew aboard a Western Finland Coast Guard surveillance aircraft spotted a high-speed waterspout touching down in the Finnish Archipelago on Friday morning. \n The team managed to film the meteorological spectacle, which took place near the island municipality of Pargas. \n Waterspouts are formed by water droplets from clouds as well as seawater, brought together by strong, spinning winds, according to Yle meteorologist  Kerttu Kotakorpi . \n The combination of thunderstorms and strong winds commonly produce so-called funnel clouds, which are cone shaped protuberances from the cloud base, Kotakorpi explained. \n \"If winds are strong enough, the funnel cloud reaches the sea level,\" she said. \n Wind speeds of at least 18 m/s are needed to form a waterspout, a weather phenomenon that can cause major damage at sea as well as on land. In North America, the more powerful variations of waterspouts are known as tornadoes and significantly more dangerous. \n The weather in southern, south-western and western areas of the country will be rather wet on Saturday, with heavy rains and autumn temperatures expected. \n However the day will be calmer in eastern and northern regions, featuring temperatures hovering above or below 15 degrees Celsius, and about 10 degrees in the north."}

The majority of grain produced in Finland is used to feed livestock. Rye is the only grain exclusively used in food production. \n Lack of fodder curbs livestock \n Many farms are now trying to cope with having less animal feed, making efforts to conserve fodder and sourcing it anywhere they can. \n \"Figures show a drop in animal numbers — with some livestock production ending and some domestic animals being taken to slaughter,\" said Partala. \n Last year, grain exports sank to the lowest level in decades, with a quarter of cereals sold by farms headed overseas. \n Oat and barley were the most popular Finnish export cereals."}
{"text": "After two summers with below-average rainfall, lake water levels are exceptionally low in many parts of Finland, and private wells are running dry. \n For instance, residents around Lake Särkemä near Hämeenlinna estimate that the lake water level is 60 cm below normal. \n Markku Rantti , head of the local Kokkila village association, says some wells in the area only have about 20 cm of water at the bottom. \n Conditions are driest in central Finland, southern Kainuu and North Savo. This is a result of scarce precipitation in July and August. Based on long-term statistics in Finland, such low rainfall levels typically only occur once every 30 years or so. \n \"The driest place seems to be around Kuopio,\" says  Bertel Vehviläinen , chief hydrologist at the Finnish Environment Institute. \n Recent rains will not provide any immediate relief. Rather, regular, plentiful rains are needed through the autumn, at least in central parts of the country, he tells Yle. \n \"The worst is if winter comes early\" \n \"It's raining there now, but that doesn't make it down to the groundwater level. First it fills the surface levels of the soil,\" Vehviläinen says. \n Before winter begins most areas need 100-200 mm of rain, he estimates. The average monthly rainfall is less than 60 mm. As winter usually begins in November in central Finland, there are only a couple of months left. \n Rain is more effective at replenishing the groundwater in autumn than in summer, as it does not evaporate from the soil due to cooler temperatures. During a snowy winter, though, groundwater aquifers do not refill at all. \n \"The worst is if winter comes early. Then the wells will remain dry until next spring,\" says Vehviläinen. \n Snow is still common in April in most of Finland, even into June in the north."}

{"text": "A special report published this week by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) focused on the dangers posed by melting ice cover, rising sea levels, warming and changing ocean chemistry and the prospect of more extreme coastal weather events. \n Earlier projections  have forecast that climate change will impact Finland by bringing shorter, wetter winters to southern parts of the country. It is possible that the volume of snowfall will not decline, but the accumulation of snow will as it melts without longer periods of sub-zero temperatures. \n Northern regions are warming at a faster pace than other parts of the globe, narrowing the environmental niche occupied by species such as Finland's Saimaa ringed seal and wolverines that  need snow banks for dens  where they birth and raise their young. \n Story continues after photo. \n Without frozen lakes and drifting snow, Finland’s endangered Saimaa ringed seal will face extinction.  Yle \n Warmer temperatures are also expected to lead to the spread of forests across the fells of  Finnish Lapland , crowding out the indigenous plant life that now thrives there. The Arctic fox, an iconic denizen of the fells, has already become a rarity and  other species may well disappear . \n A rise in winter temperatures will also increase the destruction of forests. When the forest floor is not frozen, trees are more likely to be downed by the winds of winter storms. Forests are likely to be confronted by new insect pests, as well, a development already being observed in southern parts of Finland. \n Warmer, less salty seawater \n Changes are also being registered in the Baltic Sea. The University of Turku's research station on the island of Seili the southwestern archipelago has been monitoring the temperature and salinity of waters in the area since 1967. \n Decades of data show transformations in surface waters, the topmost layer usually going down around 20 metres. \n \"The salinity of these sea waters has declined half a per mille, while at the same time, the temperature of surface waters has risen by around 1.5 degrees,\" says Associate Professor  Jari Hänninen  of the Biodiversity Unit of the University of Turku. \n Story continues after photo. \n An automated research station has been monitoring water quality off the coast of the island of Seili since 2006.  Markku Sandell / Yle \n This observation is in line with forecasts of an increase of fresh water runoff into the Baltic Sea, reducing its overall salt content. At the same time, it backs projections of rising temperatures. \n The Baltic climate is influenced by climatic conditions in the North Atlantic and changes happening there. \n \"All of the water coming into the Baltic comes from the North Atlantic,\" points out Hänninen. \n Through evaporation, fresh water makes its way into the Baltic region as clouds. Rain from these clouds drains through river systems into the Baltic Sea. \n Salt water from the North Sea enters the Baltic through the Danish straits, but the flow has diminished because of the higher rate of fresh water runoff from surrounding landmasses. \n Because of mild winters, precipitation in the form of rain and melting snow is flowing into the Baltic Sea faster than in the past, raising the sea level. This in turn prevents the inflow of saltier water from the North Sea which is a largely seasonal phenomenon associated with winter storms. \n Story continues after photo \n Professor Jari Hänninen watches as student Johannes Sahlstedt retrieves a plankton sample. Markku Sandell / Yle \n Under these circumstances, there is no room for saltwater \"pulses\" to enter the main basin of the Baltic, blocking these oxygen-laden waters from flowing into the depths of the sea. This is a change that began developing in the mid-1980s. \n The depths of the Baltic have suffered from hypoxia -  a lack of an adequate supply of oxygen  - for a long time, and no prospect of an improvement is in sight. \n Overburdened by nutrients \n Not only does the future of the Baltic Sea contain more fresh water, it will also contain higher concentrations of nutrients, bringing more eutrophication, overloading of the sea bottom with organic materials, and an accelerated loss of oxygen. \n This will impact not only the deepest parts of the sea, but also more shallow waters, as well. \n The Baltic Sea is home to a mixture of freshwater and saltwater species. As its salinity declines, saltwater species, such as the Baltic herring are coming under pressure. In contrast, freshwater species are thriving. \n Story continues after photo. \n The average size of Baltic herring has decreased significantly since the 1980s. Monica Forssell / Yle \n Monitoring of plankton and Baltic herring by the University of Turku's Archipelago Research Institute has found changes in the diet of herring in these waters as larger copepods, a kind of crustacean that the fish feed on, have disappeared. As a result, herring in the area have, on average, lost a quarter of their length and up to half of their weight since the 1980s. \n \"Baltic herring will surely not disappear from the archipelago, but in future, most of the catch will maybe come from the south of the Baltic where salinity levels are staying higher,\" explains Hänninen. \n Less ice \n The University of Turku's Seili research station lies just north of the village of Nauvo, a boat trip of around half an hour. Jari Hänninen recalls that during the 1990's it was possible to drive by car there across the ice in the winter. \n Story continues after photo. \n With warming temperatures, there will be less winter ice cover off Finland's coasts. Timo Viitanen / AOP \n In recent years, the sea has frozen over no earlier than in February and thawed in March. During that short time, travel by snowmobile or small ATV has been possible, but the trip can no longer be made by car. \n The lack of ice cover has and will impact the lives of residents and visitors in the archipelago, but it is not expected that sea levels will rise in the Gulf of Bothnia, even as melting glacial ice raises the levels of the earth's oceans. \n The land area of Finland is still springing back from the weight of the glaciers which covered it during the last ice age. So, coastal areas are rising faster than projected sea levels. It's likely to be a different story along the south coast, however, where a study by the Finnish Meteorological Institute says the risk of flooding will grow significantly by the end of the century."}

These areas could experience rainfall of up to 20-40 millimetres by 9am Wednesday. \n \"The average rainfall for October in these areas is approximately 50 to 70 millimetres, and they could receive half of that now,\" Yle meteorologist  Joonas Koskela  said. \n Päijät-Häme in southern Finland recorded more than 30 millimetres of rain in the morning. The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) has issued heavy rain warnings for central Finland, north Savo, north Karelia and south Ostrobothnia, and strong wind warnings for areas in southern and northern Finland. \n The stormy weather could result in trees being knocked down and might cause temporary electricity outages. \n Coastal areas already facing stormy conditions \n Coastal areas recorded high winds on Tuesday morning. The strongest winds were measured in southwest coastal areas, reaching more than 23.5 metres per second off Hanko, mainland Finland's southernmost point. \n Despite the strong winds and rain, Tuesday’s weather will probably not be officially classified as a storm, as the average wind speed is not expected to exceed 21 metres per second. \n The FMI has also issued a warning to seafarers about strong winds and moderate waves from Tuesday to Wednesday morning. \n Yet another warm September \n According to Koskela, Tuesday will be the rainiest day, with the heavy rain expected to recede tomorrow. \n \"There is some inconsistency in tomorrow's forecast in terms of whether it will rain or not. It might rain in south and central Finland tomorrow, but in scattered showers. There will be a definite drop in the temperature over the weekend,\" he added. \n Also on Tuesday the FMI said that last month was the 11th consecutive September with average temperatures above the long-term mean. The month also includes the second-latest date ever recorded with temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius. That occurred in several areas on 10 September, with the highest reading of 26.2 degrees in Lappeenranta, eastern Finland."}

Huutonen says that Eastern Finland’s first snow came about a week earlier than usual. Northern Lapland received its  first snow  on Sunday. \n Slippery roads, especially in the east \n The FMI warns of poor road conditions through most of eastern Finland from Friday afternoon through at least midnight due to snow or sleet, with “very bad” conditions in North Karelia. \n Story continues after photo \n Friday morning in Tohmajärvi, North Karelia.

Winter tyres are required from 1 December until the end of February. \n Potential wind hazard in western Finland \n No significant snow is in the forecast for southern and central Finland just yet, but high winds are forecast for this weekend. At this point, a large low-pressure area is on track to move across Finland on Friday night and early Saturday. \n The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) has issued  severe wind warnings  for land areas in Satakunta, Pirkanmaa and parts of Ostrobothnia from Friday evening until Saturday morning. \n It predicts strong southwesterly winds with gusts of more than 20 metres per second, potentially causing \"wind damage in numerous areas...a need for significant debris clearance, long-lasting electricity outages and disruptions in telecommunication networks\". \n In northern Finland, the FMI warns of poor road conditions due to snow on Friday afternoon and overnight. \n Those considering nautical trips this weekend should be aware there is a warning potentially dangerous gale-force winds with significant wave height exceeding 2.5 meters on most sea areas on Friday and into Saturday."}

According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), it was -26 degrees Celsius at Lake Kirakkajärvi — nearly as frigid at Nuorgam in the country's northernmost municipality, Utsjoki. \n October was about three degrees chillier than the long-term average in Northern Finland, says the FMI. The region's average temperature during the month was between -3 and -4 degrees. Meanwhile the country's mildest area was the southwestern archipelago, where the average was above +7, close to the long-term average. \n The warmest reading of the month was on 1 October in Helsinki when the mercury hit 13.4 degrees. The coldest was in the far northwestern village of Enontekiö where it sank to -24.2 on Monday. \n October was also rainier than usual, especially in North Karelia and other eastern areas. \n Slippery roads on Saturday \n More precipitation is in store on Saturday after a dry, partly sunny Friday, says Yle meteorologist  Matti Huutonen . \n It's expected to come down as rain in the southern third of the country as well as the Oulu region, with sleet in between and snow further north. \n Those driving in central and northern areas on Saturday should brace for poor driving conditions due to sleet or snow. Afternoon temperatures will range between +7 in the southwest to -13 in the northwestern arm of Lapland. \n Sunday now looks to be dry and partly clear, a brighter outlook than in previous forecasts. That goes for the early part of next week too, says Huutonen. \n While earlier projection models predicted up to 30cm of snow in southwest Finland by next Tuesday, the latest versions suggest that an expected band of precipitation may just graze the coast or miss the country altogether, he says."}

{"text": "Oulu resident and amateur photographer  Risto Mattila  was in for a bit of a shock when he came across a host of odd-looking \"eggs\" on a beach during a Sunday stroll on Hailuoto island, northern Ostrobothnia. \n Piled up on the Marjaniemi beach was a 30-metre-wide collection of objects that looked like large eggs. Mattila said he had never seen anything like it during 25 years living in the vicinity of the sea. Other people out and about on Sunday afternoon were also mystified by the egg-shaped ice and snow formations. \n \"My wife and I stood there marvelling at the remarkable natural phenomenon. Since I had a camera with me I decided to preserve this unusual sight for posterity,\" Mattila added. \n A rare phenomenon \n Jouni Vainio , an ice specialist from the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), said that the ice eggs were not a supernatural phenomenon, although they were rare. He noted that the formations require just the right air and water conditions, which have to be near freezing. \n The shallow sandy beach and just the right ebb and flow of the frigid water would be almost enough for the \"eggs\" to form, he explained. However there would also have to be another factor to allow the ball of snow and ice to form around it. \n That could be a snowflake, a small stone on the beach or even a bit of flotsam in the sea. The water would then freeze around the object, while a suitable wind would ensure continued ice build-up with the back and forth movement of the water. \n \"Too much wind would prevent the ball from forming. On the other hand, if it’s calm, [the water] would just freeze on the beach in an even layer,\" Vainio continued. \n Mattila’s encounter with the ice eggs was serendipitous, because they are usually only discernible for a short time. Regular shoreline conditions such as a high wind can easily cause them to accumulate into a large deposit of ice in which the individual eggs would no longer be visible."}
{"text": "Talks aimed at ending a strike by Finnish postal workers failed to reach a settlement over the weekend. \n As a result, a number of other unions have announced  the start of support action  to help the Finnish Post and Logistics Union PAU press its demands. \n Joining in as of Monday are the Transport Workers’ Union AKT, the Finnish Seafarers´ Union, the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors JHL and Service Union United PAM. Members of the Finnish Aviation Union IAU began supporting the strike last week, severely delaying airmail deliveries. \n The newsstand tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat reports  that so far the postal strike is causing a delay of several days in the delivery of packages and may cause delays of weeks for the delivery of letters and periodicals. Daily newspaper distribution is not, however, affected. \n Jarmo Ainasoja , Posti's Head of Exception management, told the paper that the company will be able to mitigate the effects of support action by the Transport Workers’ Union by using its network of subcontractors. \n \"There is always somebody who wants to work and take part in deliveries. We have a fairly extensive network of partners. A lot depends on how involved they become. That's something that can be better evaluated on Monday,\" said Ainasoja. \n Ilta-Sanomat warned, however that problems with post moving through port facilities can be expected. \n The paper goes on to provide a detailed day-by-day listing of union actions impacting postal deliveries through the upcoming week. \n Negotiations on a deal to end the Finnish Post and Logistics Union strike are set to resume on Monday afternoon. \n Buy seeds, but don't plant them \n The legal use of cannabis has become a hot topic again, especially after a citizens' initiative calling for its decriminalisation  passed the 50,000 signatures mark and headed to parliament  late last month. \n According to Finland's largest circulation daily, Helsingin Sanomat, the initiative has met with little enthusiasm from lawmakers, with a majority of MPs saying they oppose legalisation, and Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  pledging that his government will not push for passage. \n On Monday  the paper reported  that while cannabis is still not legal, the sale of cannabis seeds and cannabis paraphernalia is. \n The paper spoke with  Juha Vihervaara , the owner of one Helsinki shop, Seeds of Love, which openly imports and sells a wide range of cannabis seeds. \n If planted and properly cared for, these seeds will produce a plant containing the psychoactive cannabinoid THC and CBD, an active ingredient used to treat conditions like pain, insomnia, and anxiety. \n However, these seeds are not sold to be planted. By law, cannabis seeds cannot be sold to produce plants for the purpose of producing banned drugs. Instead, they can be legally sold as collectors' items and for decorative purposes. \n \"The only permitted uses for the seeds sold are collection and the preservation of genetic materials. One should not try to get the seeds to sprout, and they are not guaranteed to sprout,\" according to the Seeds of Love shop's disclaimer. \n Helsingin Sanomat notes that seed collection seems to be a popular hobby. Juha Vihervaara says that his storefront shop sees about 500 customers walk in every week and somewhat fewer in its online shop. \n There are several specialist shops in the country dealing primarily in cannabis seeds and paraphernalia, but seeds can also be found on sale by many more mainstream retailers, as well. \n Electric snow scooter \n From Lapland, where moving around in the snow is a way of life,  Lapin Kansa reports  on plans for the start of serial production of an innovative means of transport — an electric snow scooter which is being touted as the first of its kind in the world. \n The eLyly electric snow scooter. eLyly \n Pasi Kauppinen  of eLyly, the company that has designed the device, told the paper that the official launch of the scooter was planned to take place at the World Cup Levi alpine skiing event this coming weekend, but that launch has been delayed. \n Now Kauppinen says that the target is to get the first electric snow scooters on the market by next spring. \n Lapin Kansa writes that the scooters are not well suited for use in heavy snow, working best on packed snow or soft snow at depths of 10-15cm. \n The first of the scooters are likely to be targeted at commercial operators in the tourism sector. With a projected price tag of 5,000-6,000 euros, they are unlikely to replace granny's traditional kicksled anytime in the near future. \n Mediterranean breezes \n The Helsinki daily  Iltalehti  points out the obvious to anyone who has been outside — the weather in Finland is unusually warm for the time of year. \n FMI meteorologist  Petri Hoppula  explained that while the temperatures are unusual, the mechanics of the phenomenon are not. Warm air has been moving up from the south, across Poland and Belarus into the Baltic region. \n Warm air is flowing up from the eastern Mediterranean, from Greece and Turkey, where by Finnish standards, it is still full summer. \n The weather over the next few days is expected to remain humid, with fog and mist, but little fear of any downpours."}
{"text": "Sunny skies, dry weather, minus five degrees Celsius on the thermometer—and summer tyres on the road. Starting 1 June next year new legislation will allow drivers of private vehicles to use summer tyres during winter, weather permitting. \n Current rules require motorists to switch to winter tyres at the latest from the beginning of December and to use them until the end of February. However starting next June, the use of winter tyres will only be mandatory when conditions require it. \n On the other hand, if wintry road conditions occur outside of the traditional season, drivers will have to swap their cars’ summer tyres for winter versions – and this will apply from November until the end of March. \n No clear guidance on weather \n The legal reform due to take effect next year does not however, specifically describe what kind of weather requires the use of winter tyres. In Germany for example, the law states that winter tyres should be used when roads have ice, slush or black ice. \n In Finland however, legislators have acted on the assumption that motorists are rational enough to know when winter tyres are required. It is an interesting position, given that nowadays many drivers have very little experience of driving in the worst conditions that winter can serve up. \n That is mainly because a majority of road users tend to drive on well-maintained motorways, where they may only encounter the most slippery winter conditions for a few hours every season. However shorter winters could bring a greater risk of aquaplaning on even the best-kept roads, conditions that could last for weeks. \n Similarly, in the spirit of the legal reform introduced by ministry of transport and communications, motorists will not be fined for running afoul of the new law. So far the National Police Board has not even considered what kind of weather can be considered suitable for summer tyres to be used. \n The general idea in police circles is that initially at least, police will issue warnings to drivers using summer threads in challenging road conditions. \n Finland to finally define suitable winter tyres \n The new law will also call on drivers to pay closer attention to the kinds of tyres they use. During winter they will likely be transitioned away from studded tyres to friction tyres. In some quarters, friction tyres are seen as damaging to roads and consequently to state and municipal budgets. Doubts have also arisen over their environmental impact. \n Perhaps surprisingly, Finland has never stipulated what characteristics winter tyres should have. That work is currently under way at the transport and communications ministry and it is due for completion around the same time the new rules come into play. \n Story continues after photo. \n Derrick Frilund / Yle \n It seems likely that in Finland, motorists will in future be called upon to use tyres with a three-peak mountain snowflake (3PMSF) symbol, which indicates that they meet the performance criteria in snow testing for use in severe snow conditions. \n Finnish legislation will still have to be harmonised with European regulations. In addition, foreign motorists cannot be excluded from driving on Finnish roads due to unreasonable winter tyre requirements."}
