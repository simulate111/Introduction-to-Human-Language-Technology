{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat reports that  Finland only has about between 10 and 20 toy stores left  after the  sudden bankruptcy and closure of the BR and Toys 'R' Us chains  at the end of 2018. \n The toy industry association Leluyhdistys tells the paper that the wholesale trade in toys grew by 11.7 percent in 2017, but that most of the toys sold in Finland today aren't sold in dedicated toy stores, but in large supermarkets and the like. The owner of the Prisma chain of big box stores, S-Group, says its toy sales have fallen by a few percentage points every year. \n S-Group's  Emilia Lehtonen  tells HS that the reason for flagging sales is the \"changing nature of play. Children are switching to mobile and computer games at younger and younger ages.\" \n Kesko representative  Hannele Åberg  tells the paper that sales of toys have grown in the last few years in K-Citymarket locations. \n \"At first, when the electronic games and digitalization hit, it hit toy sales very hard. But toys have made a good comeback in the last few years, in our experience. Children will always need to play,\" she says. \n Conflicting reports on alcohol sales \n Ilta-Sanomat features a story on the  effects of the reformed Alcohol Act  that came into force in early 2018. One year later, the Brewer's Federation and the national health watchdog have \"completely different evaluations\" of the repercussions of the new statues, the tabloid says. \n Among other things , the new law allowed for stronger alcoholic drinks to be sold in shops and kiosks. Alko's business manager  Kari Pennanen  tells IS that overall sales at his state-owned chain of liquor stores had fallen by over 8 percent in 2018 on the previous year. He says the sale of \"lighter products\" such as non-alcoholic drinks, rosé and white wine, and champagne have grown since 2017, while the sale of long drinks, beer and cider have fallen\". \n Kari Luoto  of the Finnish Grocery Trade Association says the sales of long drinks in particular have gone up by over 60 percent in food shops, and sales of beer and cider have dropped off slightly in the last year. \n Research professor  Pia Mäkelä  of the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) says the reformed alcohol law has brought an end to a steady decline in alcohol consumption in Finland \"or it has even started to go up, which would not be a good thing in terms of the health hazards,\" she says. \n Finland's Federation of the Brewing and Soft Drinks Industry will have its final statistics on 2018 sales in February, but CEO  Riikka Pakarinen  tells IS that preliminary data shows that more strong beers and ciders were sold in 2018, but that total sales by litre were down. Mid-strength beer continues to dominate the market, accounting for 90 percent of beer sales. \n \"Non-alcoholic drinks are selling better, and at this stage, it looks as if the fears surrounding the Alcohol Act reforms have not come true, because there has not been a surge in alcohol sales. Higher taxes on alcohol have reduced sales,\" she tells IS, adding that taxation on alcoholic drinks in Finland must be lowered so that it is \"closer to European levels\". \n Sauli has the last word \n And to finish, Verkkouutiset features a  comment from Finnish President Sauli Niinistö  in response to  criticism of his choice of words in his annual New Year's Day address  to the nation. \n Green MP Ozan Yanar joined  several others  in criticizing Niinistö's phrase asking migrant communities to \"bear responsibility by guiding their own\". \n Yanar took to  social media  on Thursday to comment on why he felt the President's choice of words was inappropriate, urging his readers to imagine that a Finn was accused of an extremely offensive crime in a foreign country, after which the president of that country encouraged the immigrant groups there to \"guide their own\". \n The Turkish-born MP said it was an \"absurd\" suggestion from the point of view of an individual who had nothing to do with it. \n Niinistö responded to Niinistö's tweet on Twitter by explaining that \"I spoke of 'those here', i.e. all individuals in Finland, regardless of their background. Both in my speech and in my interview with Helsingin Sanomat, I did not use collective expressions like immigrant community or group, because I was taking about individuals.\""}

{"text": "The nationalist Finns Party scored the biggest gains in the latest Yle/ Taloustutkimus party poll. The party's support has risen by more than two percentage points to 10.2 percent since the last survey, still within the poll's 2.1-percentage-point margin of error. \n This is the first time the populist party’s support has passed 10 percent since last June – but still far below its peak of 19.1 percent in the  2011 election . \n According to pollster Taloustutkimus research director  Tuomo Turja , Finns Party support clearly rose immediately after recent news of crimes attributed to immigrants  in Oulu  and  Helsinki . \n SDP and NCP neck-and-neck \n Meanwhile the rivalry between the two most popular parties, the Social Democrats (SDP) and the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), is heating up. The SDP again emerged in the top spot, but its backing dipped to 21.2 percent – as the NCP was breathing down its neck, rising to 19.6 percent. \n Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party saw voter approval slide to 16.1 percent, its lowest level in nearly a year and a half. Turja notes that the biggest losses in Centre support were among men and residents of the Oulu region – Sipilä’s home district. \n Greens' rise levels off \n Two months ago, the opposition Greens chose former chair, government minister and presidential contender  Pekka Haavisto  as their new leader after the previous chair stepped down for health reasons. \n That sparked a  sharp rise in party support  in November, which has now dropped off. Party support edged down slightly to 13.6 percent, still enough to keep them within shouting distance of the traditional ‘big three’ parties. \n Turja points out that if the Greens’ electoral result is between 13.5 and 14 percent, that would be a major gain since the last parliamentary and municipal elections. \n The Left Alliance’s popularity was up by one percentage point to 9.5 percent. Turja says the opposition party is gaining popularity among women as well as white-collar workers. \n The other parties – including junior government partners the Blue Reform – all garnered well below five percent support. \n Red-Greens could gain 26 seats in Parliament \n With less than three months to go before advance voting begins on April 3, Taloustutkimus has made preliminary projections as to how the parties might fare in terms of seats in Parliament, based on the last six monthly polls. \n Parties now in opposition stand to gain the most seats, says the pollster. \n The SDP could pick up 13 more seats to give them a bloc of 47 MPs in the 200-seat legislature, raising them from the third-largest to the biggest party in the chamber. \n The Greens would gain 10 seats for a total of 25, while the Left Alliance might add three for a 15-member delegation. \n Of the three current government parties, the NCP is poised to add six seats for a total of 43 MPs. The premier’s Centre, meanwhile, looks likely to drop seven seats, falling behind the NCP with one seat less at 42. \n The number-crunchers compared the latest data with figures from the spring 2015 parliamentary election. \n They predict that based on current polling, the Finns Party are on track to lose two seats from their current 17, giving them a 15-seat bloc, on par with the Left. That would be a precipitous drop of 23 seats from the 2015 election – as the party split in mid-2017. \n A splinter group left to establish the Blue Reform party, which despite ministerial posts has failed to excite voters’ interest so far – sttracting support of just one percent in this poll. \n Taloustutkimus interviewed 2,443 people between 10 December and 8 January. It puts the margin of error at +/- 2.1 percentage points for the larger parties."}
{"text": "Finland's Feminist Party, Pirate Party, Animal Justice Party and Liberal Party have decided to come together to create a joint electoral union in Helsinki ahead of the parliamentary elections on 14 April. \n \"With this configuration, we only need a few thousand more votes to give our electoral union a seat in parliament,\" says  Katju Aro , Feminist Party chair. \n \"Our minimum objective is one place; it is a realistic goal. It looks as if we will be able to achieve this with our union,\"  Petrus Pennanen , chair of the Pirate Party, agrees. \n A total of 13,528 votes was enough to gain the final parliamentary seat representing Helsinki in 2015, which went to a Finns Party candidate. \n About 3,000 votes short \n In the  2017 municipal elections , the four political parties in question earned 10,395 votes when counted together in the capital city, meaning that the new electoral union would only need a slightly over 3,000-vote improvement on this turnout to earn a MP post. \n The Pirate Party is the largest of the four future electoral union's parties on the national level, but the Feminist Party gained the largest share of votes from Helsinki in the municipal elections two years ago. \n \"During the municipal elections we surprised everyone and gained a spot, even though our party had only been registered two months earlier. We will try to do the same thing now,\" Aro says. \n Story continues after the photo \n Pirate Party chair Petrus Pennanen Yle \n Nine extra-parliamentary parties are vying for parliamentary seats in mid-April. In addition to the four parties of the newly-formed electoral union, there's the Communist Party, the Communist Worker's Party, the Citizen's Party, the Independence Party and Finnish People First. \n Borg: Outlier parties rarely see election success \n Ten extra-parliamentary parties ran for seats in the Finnish Parliament in 2003 and 2007, but only 7 or 8 ran in 2011 and 2015. Tampere University researcher and election expert  Sami Borg  says outlier political parties rarely receive enough votes to secure a MP position. \n \"There have been exceptions, of course, such as with the Greens and Young Finns,\" he says. \n Borg says the reason for this is clear. \n \"Parliamentary parties have completely different financial resources to use in their election campaigns and gain visibility during the parliamentary term,\" he says. \n Unlike in other countries, Finnish residents are spoiled for choice when it comes to election candidates, as two new parliamentary parties ( Blue Reform  and  Seven Star Movement ) have been established over the last parliamentary term alone, in addition to one new political movement ( Movement Now ). \n This is in addition to the eight political parties that were voted into the Finnish Parliament in 2015: The Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Social Democratic Party, Finns Party, the Greens, Left Alliance, Swedish People's Party, and Christian Democrats. \n A total of 19 registered political parties and one political movement are therefore vying for a position in the upcoming general elections. Local electoral organizations can add even more candidates to the roster in some areas. \n Tough competition for Helsinki representation \n Analysts predict that there will be  tough competition for parliamentary seats  in the electoral districts of Helsinki and the Uusimaa region to which it belongs this spring. Smaller parties like the Blue Reform, Movement Now and Seven Star Movement are expected to target capital city voters. \n \"We're still holding out for that Helsinki seat. If we can push a candidate through in Uusimaa, then maybe it will give rise to another opportunity,\" says the Feminist Party's Aro. \n \"Our strongest support areas are university cities. We've currently got a municipal representative in both Helsinki and Jyväskylä,\" Pirate Party's Pennanen says. \n The reason so many of the more marginal political parties are concentrating their efforts in Helsinki is because of the low threshold of votes required to gain a parliamentary seat there. In the last general elections, winning just 3.7 percent of the vote was enough to become an MP in Helsinki, while 2.5 percent was sufficient in Uusimaa. \n Several Uusimaa MPs have also said that they would be relinquishing their parliamentary seat in the next election, freeing up close to 63,000 votes. In Helsinki this number is close to 30,000. Both leave room for new faces."}
{"text": "Finland has established a new food market ombudsman's role. The position, an initiative of Agriculture Minister  Jari Leppä , formally came into being on 1 January. The ministry will begin advertising the new post this month with the hope of filling the position in February. \n The central role of the food market ombudsman will be to oversee the functioning of the domestic produce market and to ensure that players comply with good business practices. \n The ombudsman’s office will be supported with two staff members and will operate as part of the ministry’s Food Agency with an annual budget of 500,000 euros. \n Leppä noted that there is a serious imbalance in the local food chain, specifically pointing to the role of large groceries. \n \"Stores are extremely strong players. This imbalance has resulted in unwholesome practices and we want to curb them,\" the minister added. \n A study published in December last year indicated that  retailers’ share of food prices has shrunk , while prices in the food processing industry have increased. \n However Leppä said that the research does not tell the whole truth about long-term developments in the sector. \n \"The report was relatively narrow and does not reveal operations in the entire sector. The general trend has been for cash flows to go everywhere else but to farmers,\" he commented. \n Large chains have upper hand, minister says \n The minister said that he had been contacted on many occasions about unhealthy retailer practices. Citing a recent case that came to his attention, he claimed that producers were being held to ransom by large chains wanting to white-label products to be sold under their proprietary Pirkka (Kesko Group) and Rainbow (S-Group) brands. \n \"When a store wants some version of a branded product made under its own label and if the producers don’t provide them as such, then no branded product will appear on the shelves,\" the minster stated. \n Leppä added that while this is not always the case, \"there are many examples.\" The lobby group representing food retailers said that it is not familiar with the situation the minister described. \n \"We have not encountered such a phenomenon. It doesn’t sound familiar,\" said Finnish Grocery Trade Association (PTY) CEO  Kari Luoto . \n Unnecessary, if not disruptive \n PTY said that the introduction of a food ombudsman will not change the industry since there is nothing wrong with current grocery practices. Rather, the group said that a new layer of oversight would be detrimental to the market. \n A new food market law introduced to regulate the work of the ombudsman calls for producers to have written agreements with all food processors and retailers. \n Luoto noted that producers do not want written agreements because of the red tape involved. He added that making them compulsory might jeopardise the status of small producers, although the goal is to strengthen their position. \n \"Recent years have seen an increase in products from very small local food producers on store shelves. We now fear that bureaucracy will further complicate this relationship,\" he commented. \n The PTY said that the best way to resolve problems relating to grocers’ practices would be for a self-regulating industry body or board to rule on disputes. The new legislation requires the ombudsman to cooperate with the board and to request statements from it before making a decision on a case. \n The ombudsman can resolve disputes by way of negotiation and may also offer recommendations if needed as well as reprimands and public warnings. Ultimately, he or she may also send cases to the Market Court for resolution. \n A new provision also calls for the ombudsman to review agreements among food producers, processors and retailers, including prices and other terms and conditions agreed. \n \"We know producer and consumer prices, but we don’t know what happens in the chain. That’s why the discussion has been a 'he-said, she-said debate'\" Leppä noted."}

The party has said that it wants to work towards increasing resources for police and how such funding would be best distributed. \n The party has also raised the issue of personal consumer debt and has proposed making it possible to erase people's first payment default notices after the debt is fully paid. \n The Blue Reform's party chair, Minister for European Affairs, Culture and Sports  Sampo Terho , said he is hopeful about the future. \n \"I am certain that we will create a parliamentary group.

{"text": "Finland's news media all carry distressing statistics this Tuesday, following police reports of aggravated sexual offenses allegedly committed by asylum seekers and recent migrants against minors in Oulu. \n Amid the growing concern,  daily Helsingin Sanomat  publishes detailed figures from the National Police Board and Statistics Finland that show an increase in sexual attacks against minors since the year 2000. The number of cases reported that year was some 500, compared to nearly 1,700 in the worst year of 2011, many years before the steep rise in immigration. \n HS writes that the number of sexual offenses against minors grew last year, from some 1,200 to 1,400 reported cases. The severity of the charges has also risen; in 2000 some 15 percent of all sexual assault cases against minors were considered aggravated, whereas last year about a third of cases were prosecuted as aggravated. \n Risk factors \n The majority of the perpetrators in all cases of sexual assault and rape that took place in Finland were Finnish natives, according to the paper. \n However, last year one-fifth of suspected perpetrators in cases against minors were foreign citizens and about one-third of suspects in all cases of rape were non-Finnish, according to HS. \n Police figures show that foreign suspects in cases of child abuse in Finland hailed mainly from Iraq, Afghanistan, Estonia and Iran. \n A large proportion of asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan are young men, and 20-34-year-old people from Iraq were found to be some 10 times more likely in 2017 to commit sexual offenses of some kind than Finnish citizens of the same age. Accurate comparisons were not possible on Monday due to a lack of fresh information on the age of asylum seekers. \n HS cites a Norwegian report that shows the reason for migration plays a crucial part in the likelihood that an immigrant might commit crimes in the foreign country they are in. Immigrants who arrive because of work, studies or family are equally or even less likely than Finnish-born people to commit illegal acts, the study found. \n Researcher  Martti Lehti  from the University of Helsinki says in HS that asylum seekers are the most challenging group of people to help integrate into Finnish society. People seeking asylum are generally fleeing some form of violence or persecution. \n \"Asylum seekers tend to have less schooling than other groups, leading to a smaller chance of employment,\" Lehti says. \"Slow employment, again, feeds crime.\" \n Human rights discussed \n Meanwhile,  tabloid Ilta-Sanomat  writes that president  Sauli Niinistö  used his time with Chinese president  Xi Jinping  on Monday to cover numerous issues face to face with China's leader. Among the issues discussed were China's human rights track record and ongoing controversial policy moves. \n Amid inspections of China's military and reminiscences about the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, Niinistö told IS he got in questions about the dozen or so Canadian nationals being held in custody by Beijing as well as the fate of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs, who are being actively oppressed and monitored by the Chinese government in the western Xinjiang region according to human rights advocacy groups. \n Niinistö was tight-lipped about the nature of his conversations with president Xi. \n \"We talked through all of it. We spoke for about an hour and the subject matter did not upset the host at all,\" Niinistö said. \n Niinistö also said in IS that he spoke with Xi about the relationship between the three major world powers – the US, China and Russia – and about Korean tensions. As for the inflamed trade dispute between America and China, Niinistö's take was brief and nonchalant. \n \"There's some sense of hope in the air, I suppose – at least nothing dark on the economic horizon. But let's not affect the stock market, now,\" Niinistö told the tabloid."}
{"text": "Finnish lawmakers tore into plans by government to raise customer health care costs during a parliamentary debate on Wednesday. MPs have begun discussing a new law proposal which government said would make patient health care costs fairer to everyone across the country. \n However, several opposition lawmakers said that the plans would make visits to health care clinics more expensive for society's most vulnerable populations. \n The subsidised fees people in Finland pay to go to public health care clinics vary quite a bit across the country's hundreds of municipalities. Now, in new draft legislation, government aims to unify those costs across the board. \n The pending bill states that a visit to a health care centre should not cost more than €20.60 and that the cost for a visit to a specialist physician should be a maximum of €41.20. \n Minister: Harmonised fees throughout \n Centre Party vice chair and Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services  Annika Saarikko  said the reform would make the health care system more equal for everyone in different parts of Finland. \n \"For example, it would become much clearer for older people who [often find themselves] in a jungle of fees. Especially when you look at locations, we'll get clear rules on what it will cost and what criteria are used to determine the prices,\" Saarikko said. \n One of the specific aims of government's proposal stipulates that customers' health clinic fees should not rise due to government's long-pending reforms on the social and health care system, colloquially known as ' Sote '. \n That reform aims to remove responsibility for healthcare from municipalities, passing it to new regional authorities, and expanding private provision of healthcare services. \n \"Customer fees will be written into law so that individual regions can't introduce unreasonable fees as a way to solve their financial emergencies,\" Saarikko said. \n Government has also proposed that virtually all health care services for children should be free-of-charge. The bill states that people under the age of 18 would only be charged for health care services in exceptional cases, for example if a patient misses a booked appointment. \n Opposition: More expensive health care overall \n Opposition MPs roundly criticised the proposal, saying it would make health care services more expensive, particularly for those who require a lot of care. \n Left Alliance MP  Li Andersson  said a change to the current system would most affect people on limited incomes who require a lot of health care services. \n \"The big problem is covering improvement costs by raising fees for basic health care services. That means people would pay more for each visit, for example when they see a doctor at a health care centre,\"Andersson said. \n The reason there's a risk that the proposed law change could effectively raise consumer health care costs is due to the fact that individual patients currently only pay for a maximum of three visits per year, which amounts to an annual maximum of 61.80 euros. Alternatively, municipalities can also charge a yearly fee of 41.20 euros. \n Government's proposal includes a provision that patients would end up paying a maximum of 683 euros per year for health care, including dental services. \n Opposition MP from the Swedish People's Party (SPP)  Veronica Rehn-Kivi  echoed Andersson's sentiments, saying the proposed law would hit those who are at most risk in society. \n \"In other words if you go to the doctor once a month the sum would be €247.20 per year. That's a huge price increase,\" Rehn-Kivi said in a press release. \n \"At the same time government is raising yearly health care fee [ceilings] there are more than 300,000 [unpaid personal] health care bills that go to collection agencies. It is people who are most vulnerable in our society who will have an even more difficult time,\" Rehn-Kivi said. \n Minister: Fees will not rise \n However, Minister Saarikko defended the criticism by saying that on the whole, fees would not go up. \n \"The overall fees that municipalities and the state receive from customers are roughly the same. This is an [overall] total in which individual fees can go up for individual customers, but other fees for others can go down,\" Saarikko said. \n She said the proposed law would give less well-off customers a right to lower health clinic fees. \n \"It will become clearer for those on low incomes that they have the right to lower health care fees. The [health care] regions will have to inform [low income customers] about their right to discounts,\" Saarikko said. \n Saarikko also defended on Wednesday the controversial proposal to permit smaller private hospitals to carry out the same kind of surgeries which were revoked from smaller public hospitals about a year ago. That decision was strongly criticised by the SPP and politicians from the west-coast city of Vaasa, which was left without an accident and emergency department and provision of certain services. \n Saarikko also stood by government's proposal to expand the capability of public hospitals to  outsource non-urgent surgeries  to private health care providers. \n She said the reasoning behind the proposal is to set up common ground rules for private and public health care providers and to secure peoples' access to those services. \n \"We need the laws so that the national health care guarantee also works when facilities are busy and public hospitals are unable to carry out all of the needed operations,\" Saarikko said. \n When asked why surgeries could not be carried out by the public hospitals which have previously done them, Saarikko said it was a matter of resources. \n \"Yes, it's a matter of nothaving enough expertise personnel, patient security and the need to cut the costs of health care,\" Saarikko said."}

He was booked last-minute for the appearance after vice-president of the European Commission  Jyrki Katainen  was delayed in Vienna. \n The minister also repeated his stance that dual citizens who are found guilty of aggravated sexual assault should be summarily stripped of their Finnish citizenship. Mykkänen previously suggested the measure in December. \n \"It's unacceptable for someone to come to Finland in search of safety only to create more insecurity themselves. These crimes have no place in this country, and we cannot let the matter rest.\" \n Police in Oulu said Friday that they have launched a preliminary investigation into four new cases of suspected sexual abuse of girls under the age of 15. The announcement follows a previous round of investigations last November in which eight immigrant-background men were detained  on suspicion of committing five similar offences  against underage girls. \n In a release issued on Friday, police said that the alleged offences took place during summer 2018. Law enforcement have held three foreign-background individuals in connection with the crimes. Police suspect four people of the alleged offences, two of whom are about 20 and two are minors. \n According to Mykkänen, the suspects in the newest assault cases have come to Finland from Northern Africa and the Middle East. Some of the suspected men are Finnish citizens and some are awaiting asylum decisions, he said. \n PM: \"I cannot understand\" \n On Friday Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä  also expressed his grief and \"disgust\" at the new series of sexual crimes, saying he understands the worry and anxiety that many people are feeling. \n Sipilä said that everyone who comes to Finland should respect Finland's laws and the principle of personal integrity. He said that Finland's asylum system cannot protect criminals. \n \"Our thoughts are with the victims and their families following these completely inhumane and reprehensible acts. I cannot understand this kind of violence and indifference.\" \n Blue Reform promotes hard line \n Following Friday's announcement the conservative political party Blue Reform is demanding that government hold an emergency meeting over the suspicions of sexual assault. Chair  Sampo Terho  said in a statement that more information is needed. \n \"The government must receive the necessary facts and hear what courses of action experts are suggesting.

{"text": "A majority of leaders of parties in Parliament said they support boosting the number of police in Finland by around 650 in the near future, according to an Yle security policy survey. \n Yle asked political party chairs whether or not police resources should rise to 7,850 as the National Police Board has recommended to match  the strength of the force  at the beginning of 2010. Finland currently has roughly 7,200 police in the force. \n Centre Party chair Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä  said in the survey that the force should be boosted to 7,850 by 2023. He noted that in many municipalities, police take too long to respond to emergencies. \n Social Democratic Party deputy chair  Sanna Marin  said that a key plank of the incoming administration (after elections in April) should be to consistently increase the number of officers in police ranks. She added that the public should be able to trust that they can get help when they need it. \n Finance Minister and National Coalition Party chair  Petteri Orpo  remained on the fence on the issue of beefing up the force. Orpo said that his party is committed to at least preserving the current number of police officers and ensuring that they can serve the entire country. The Interior Ministry under NCP MP  Kai Mykkänen  is currently evaluating the number of personnel required to best discharge police duties. \n Police union: One in ten calls neglected \n Chair of the police union SPJL  Jonne Rinne  said that in addition to their opinions on staffing, he wants to see concrete action from political decision-makers. Supplementing police numbers to 7,850 is a good start, he noted. \n \"The police force has been depleted during the last decade. In that sense this is certainly a positive message. But I hope that in addition to opinions this would lead to concrete measures,\" he commented. \n Rinne said that he believed that recent reporting on  suspected sexual offences against children  may have prompted leaders to see the need to increase police resources. \n \"Police alone won’t solve every problem, but society must find the means to address these matters and resolves them. Police need to have sufficient resources to safeguard the public’s right to legal protection in such unfortunate circumstances,\" Rinne noted. \n The union leader said that it is unacceptable that police do not have adequate resources to respond to calls, something that shows in the field as well as in investigative work. \n \"In practice, one in ten calls is neglected. I consider this a rather large number. When people are in need they turn to the police. Police must then inform them that unfortunately we cannot respond to this emergency call,\" he continued. \n Police will see an easing of the personnel crunch this year, since 150 more trainees than the previous year will graduate from the Police College Academy. Officials had previously increased the number of study places to prevent a further shrinking of the force."}

Niinistö opened a climate seminar and will meet with Prime Minister  Li Keqiang  and speaker of China's national congress  Li Zhanshu . \n Niinistö was accompanied by Foreign Trade and Development Minister  Anne-Mari Virolainen , European Affairs, Culture and Sports Minister  Sampo Terho  and a business delegation of 100. \n Their last meeting in Helsinki in April 2017 was characterised by  panda diplomacy . China gifted Finland a pair of giant pandas to celebrate its 100th birthday. At the time Finland re-affirmed its commitment to the 'one China' policy, meaning that Finland officially recognises the People's Republic of China—not Taiwan. \n Story continues after photo. \n Lumi Tarmo Niemi / Yle \n Giant pandas Lumi and Pyry (officially Jin Baobao and Hua Bao) arrived at Ähtäri Zoo in early 2018. \n 'Average' relationship \n Finland has not had a particularly good relationship with China,  Jyrki Kallio , a senior researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (FIIA), told Yle, saying that Finland’s ties with the world's most populous country are not unique in any way. \n At the end of last year, Finland was party to a letter by 15 Western ambassadors demanding that China explain its persecution against the country’s Uighur minority. Meanwhile the timing of this week's trip makes Niinistö one of the first European leaders to meet Xi after news broke of ’re-education’ internment camps for Uighur Muslims, something China has previously denied. In this light, Kallio said he believed the world’s eyes will be on the topics broached by Niinistö. \n Finland’s Foreign Ministry has  highlighted the plight  of China’s Uighur minority, and Kallio expects Niinistö may bring up the issue. \n Following China's lead \n On Xi's last visit to Finland, Niinistö faced criticism for playing to China’s tune. The Finnish president did not host a press conference following his powwow with Xi, which would have given the press an opportunity to unpack the contents of the meeting. \n China is easily offended, according to Kallio. He said China cooled on Sweden after the  Dalai Lama 's visit there, and Norway fell out of favour after its Nobel committee in 2010 awarded the peace prize to Chinese dissident  Liu Xiaobo . \n Hockey diplomacy? \n China is an economic powerhouse with many countries vying for a piece of the action. That said, Finland faces balancing its own financial interests with its image as a human rights champion. \n In China, Niinistö and his wife,  Jenni Haukio , will attend the opening of the China-Finland Winter Sports Year, an idea born out of Xi’s and Niinistö’s 2017 meeting to \"dedicate a theme year to winter sports between the two countries\"."}

{"text": "In a Saturday morning television appearance, Defence Minister  Jussi Niinistö  criticized results of a fresh pre-election Yle survey of parliamentary party leaders in which the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Left Alliance, Greens and Finns Party leaders said they would be willing to entertain the idea of cutting fighter plane numbers. \n \"Pretty surprising information, especially when you consider that the Finns Party has joined with the red-green opposition. This is about whether we are interested in defending our country or not. If we cut the number of fighter planes at our disposal, then we need to start haggling over which areas are most in need of defence. This is irresponsible politics, in my opinion,\" he said on Yle's Ykkösaamu programme. \n Finland's fleet of Hornet fighter planes will soon come to the end of its service life, and replacing all 64 of them in the next decade is expected to cost the Finnish state upwards of 10 billion euros, when lifetime service and maintenance costs are included. The  Defence Forces has already started the bidding process , with the aim to replace the entire fleet. \n Largest opposition party: Nothing written in stone \n Party leaders responded to an Yle survey question asking \"Can Finland procure fewer fighter jets than the tender request amount of 64?\" Representatives of the Greens, SDP, Left Alliance and Finns Party answered 'Yes', while party chairs from the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party (NCP), Blue Reform, Swedish People's Party (SPP) and the Christian Democrats said 'No'. \n \"It's not about a specific number of planes, but the overall solution. The number of fighter jets to be acquired is not written in stone, as the amount will only be determined once responses to the call for tenders have been properly processed and the different options have been mapped out,\" said MP  Sanna Marin , who stood in for SDP party chair  Antti Rinne  – who is recovering from pneumonia – ­in the survey. \n Left Alliance Chair  Li Andersson  called for a critical discussion of the fleet investment, while the Greens' head  Pekka Haavisto  said that all options should remain on the table due to swift technological advancement. \n Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  accompanied his 'Yes' vote with the following comment: \n \"Finland is a small country and our defence allocations are very limited. It is very important that we focus on our strengths and avoid any misjudgement.\" \n Defence Minister Jussi Niinistö said in his Saturday morning interview that a fleet of 100 fighter jets would not be far-fetched in Finland, as this would be enough to ensure the continued defence of the entire country. He conceded that the additional planes would bring a considerably higher price tag, but argued that an even larger fleet would also be able to better cover possible faults and repairs. \n \"We are already showing restraint in our handling of the matter,\" he said. \n Social exclusion as largest internal threat \n In early January, Yle asked representatives of Finland's nine parliamentary political parties their opinions on a series of foreign and security policy questions. \n Along with the fighter jet question, the party leaders were asked about their stance on NATO membership, with only the NCP's  Petteri Orpo  and the SPP's  Anna-Maja Henriksson  supporting Finland joining the military alliance. None of the nine chairs were in support of cancelling Finland's participation in sanctions against Russia. \n When the party leaders were asked to name what they feel is the largest internal security threat at present in Finland, eight out of nine wrote social exclusion and inequality \n Only the nationalist Finns Party chair Halla-aho penned a different reply: \"The quickly growing, poorly integrated immigrant population\"."}

This leaves the three-party government coalition with one less seat in Parliament, endangering several pending legal reforms that must be voted on before the current parliamentary terms end. \n Lohela's move further imperils the government's planned  overhaul of social and health care services , colloquially known as \"sote\", on which MPs have yet to cast a final vote. The ex-Speaker said she would vote against the reform. She roundly condemned the government's flagship programme, which has the support of her former colleagues in the Blue Reform, saying that the needs of ordinary people have been eclipsed by the interests of market forces and regional reforms, at the behest of the National Coalition Party and the Centre Party respectively. \n \"I asked myself what my duty is in this matter as a member of parliament and I cannot in good conscience support these things,\" she commented. \n Lohela's defection further narrows the government's already razor-thin majority on the issue to just one vote: a total of 99 lawmakers now oppose the raft of measures compared to 100 who would vote to see it through. As it stands, the loss of a single vote would scupper the long-in-the-making reform package. \n Other MPs who have publicly opposed the social and health care reform proposal include the NCP 's  Elina Lepomäki  and  Susanna Koski  as well as veteran lawmaker  Paavo Väyrynen ,  who quit the Centre Party  last spring. \n Already defected once before \n Lohela was elected as an MP from the Southwest Finland region in 2011, as a member of the nationalist Finns Party.

After the spilt from the Finns Party in 2017, Lohela  vacated her Speaker position in February  2018 and returned to her MP role. \n Polling for the Blue Reform since the split in 2017 has been very low.

{"text": "As parliamentary elections draw closer, a fresh Yle poll shines light on a political landscape in upheaval. The biggest loser in the survey conducted between 14 January and 5 February has been the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), which saw voter approval slip to 17.3 percent, down 2.3 percentage points from the last poll. \n The last time voter backing for the NCP reached this level was back in 2016, when  Petteri Orpo  had just taken over the reins from ex-premier  Alexander Stubb  as party leader. Pollster Taloustutkimus speculated that the party has suffered as a result of heated debate over the quality of care at senior care homes, with the party  unable to articulate a clear position  on minimum nurse quotients per patient. \n Taloustutkimus research director  Tuomo Turja  said that declining approval for the party among women and the elderly in particular confirm the suspicion. \n Party leader's absence hurting SDP  \n The NCP's adverse showing signals good news for the largest opposition group, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which will likely compete with the NCP to field a prime minister following April's general election, the pollster noted. \n The SDP did see a slight erosion in support of 1.1 percentage points to 20.1 percent, but still retained the top spot in the survey. At the same time, the NCP has not been able to continue narrowing the gap between the top two parties, as it had been doing late last year. \n Turja said that  the elder care debate and the discussion about nursing quotas  have been a boon for the SDP, with the party using its union roots to dominate the staffing debate in recent weeks. However with chair  Antti Rinne  on extended sick leave, the party currently has no de facto prime ministerial candidate. First deputy chair  Sanna Marin  has been filling in for Rinne in the interim. \n Faithful return to Finns Party fold, Greens attract others' voters  \n The immigration-sceptic Finns Party posted the biggest gains in this poll, continuing a trend of gathering increased support from voters. With 12 percent voter approval, the party is closing in on its best performance among voters, which occurred back in 2015 when it grabbed 15 percent of the ballot in the general election. \n However as a government party, it saw voters abandon it as the number of asylum seekers arriving in Finland increased, the administration introduced austerity policies and workers' rights weakened. The party splintered in June 2017 when current chair  Jussi Halla-aho  ousted  Timo Soini  as party leader. \n Turja noted that the Finns Party was not leaching support from other parties, and speculated that the voters who had abandoned it and remained uncommitted to any party were now returning to the fold. Its performance may have also received a boost from  sustained reporting on suspicions  of child sexual abuse in Oulu, he added. \n The opposition Greens also saw voter support inch up by one percentage point to 14.6 in the latest survey, reinforcing their fourth-place status. The party's fortunes have improved since last autumn, when political veteran  Pekka Haavisto  took over from  Touko Aalto  as party chair. \n \"With the Greens, we can clearly see that they are getting support from other parties, especially the SDP and the NCP,\" Turja commented. \n Centre backing lowest in years  \n The Greens are nipping at the heels of Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party in third place with 15.6 percent voter approval. The last time backing for the Centre was this low was during summer 2012, when Sipilä assumed the mantle of party chair. \n Its current level of support is also lower than its haul in the 2011 parliamentary elections, when just 15.8 percent of voters cast ballots for the Centre. \n The Left Alliance also slipped nearly a full percentage point to 8.6 percent voter backing. Turja said its supporters were likely also heading over to the Green camp. \n Among the small parties, the Swedish Peoples' Party posted four percent voter approval, while the Christian Democrats and government party the Blue Reform (which split off from the Finns Party) attracted 3.6 and 1.4 percent of voter support respectively."}

The vote followed an interpellation accusing the cabinet of failing to ensure sufficient staffing at old age homes amid  widespread reports of neglect . \n In a rare move, all the opposition parties and groups joined in the formal challenge spearheaded by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has been leading public opinion polls ahead of elections in April. \n The interpellation also questioned whether the government's planned overhaul of the social and health care system, known as sote, would guarantee residents equal access to services. \n The vote was the strongest challenge to Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's centre-right cabinet since took office in May 2015. \n The three government parties have just 102 MPs in the 200-seat chamber, not counting Speaker of Parliament – and former social services minister –  Paula Risikko  of the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), who only votes in case of a tie. \n The dozen absent representatives included two SDP leaders who are on sick leave, chair  Antti Rinne  and deputy chair  Maarit Feldt-Ranta , as well as three MPs from government parties. No MPs broke party ranks. \n Government parties change their tune \n Earlier in the week, SDP delegation leader  Antti Lindtman  noted triumphantly that just after the  interpellation was announced , two of the coalition partners, the Centre and Blue Reform parties, changed their position on whether a minimum caregiver ratio at elder facilities should be mandated by law. On Tuesday the NCP also said it was ready to consider whether such a requirement should be written into law. \n The same day, Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services  Annika Saarikko  from Sipilä's Centre Party said that the government would begin preparations to do so. However it remains unclear whether Parliament will have time to pass the legislation before its term ends on 15 March. Advance voting for the next Parliament begins on 3 April. \n The opposition demanded that senior facilities be required to have at least seven caregivers per 10 residents. At present there is merely a recommendation that there be at least five per 10 residents. There is also some debate over whether only nurses or also other staff members should be included in this calculation. \n The issue was thrust back into the national political debate when the health and welfare watchdog Valvira suspended the operations of a company in the west-coast town of Kristiinankaupunki due to serious neglect of elders in its care. That was followed by reports from Yle and other outlets uncovering widespread problems in the sector throughout the country."}
{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat  leads  with an expose of an unusual proposal to the Finnish government to expedite deportations to Iraq. HS reports that the Finnish presenter of The Apprentice, MP  Harry Harkimo , arranged meetings for  Peter Fryckman , a businessman with fraud convictions, and  Saad al-Obaidi , an Iraqi who served as a general under  Saddam Hussein , in an effort to move the proposal forward. \n In a nutshell, the proposed deal was that Finland would purchase expensive defence products for Iraq, which would then sign an accord guaranteeing it would accept deported Iraqis. At present it  only accepts  those with identity papers, voluntary returnees and those convicted of crimes. \n Since 2015 several thousand Iraqis have had asylum claims rejected by Finland and are believed to be undocumented migrants in the country. The Interior Ministry believes there are around 5,000 such Iraqis in Finland, and that their undocumented status makes them a security risk. \n Fryckman proposed in 2016 that the procurements be made via the little-known Swedish Defence Equipment company, which has a small turnover and little track record in major projects like this. The chair of the company’s board  Sven Olof Kviman  told HS that the units (apparently shipping containers converted to screen people for weapons) would be constructed in Iraq. \n HS reckoned that the price quoted—100 million euros or a million euros per container—was around ten times more than similar products would cost if purchased elsewhere. \n Needless to say, al-Obaidi and Fryckman declined to comment on the story. Foreign Minister  Timo Soini , who set up a meeting after he was contacted by Harkimo, also kept schtum. \n Several officials had poor memory of meetings they attended, while Defence Minister  Jussi Niinistö’s  special advisor went to meet the pair with the Interior Ministry’s head of immigration  Jorma Vuorio . \n It was a no-frills encounter, a short meeting that got straight to the point and where ‘not even water was offered’, according to Vuorio. HS noted that, given its shaky foundations, the entire proposal was at least open to accusations of corruption. \n Care home scandal rumbles on \n Several papers carry the STT  report  on the town of Varkaus preparing to make a criminal complaint about the care home operator Attendo. The local authority believes the firm is operating a facility with staff levels so low they are breaching their license. \n Municipal employees are currently visiting the home in question every day and sometimes at night to keep tabs on what's happening, and STT reports that they believe the Jalava home is not operating with the required staffing levels, management procedures or professionally-trained personnel. \n Meanwhile Savon Sanomat  interviews  the sacked manager of the unit.  Virpi Montonen  said that she believes she's a scapegoat, and that individual managers have little power to make the required changes. \n \"All decisions went via the regional management,\" Montonen tells the paper. \"Independent decisions can't be made, only recommendations.\" \n Montonen had transferred to the Varkaus facility from an assisted living location in Kuopio, and said the contrast was stark. She said that the Jalava license stated a minimum of 0.5 staff members per resident was required. She kept the ratio at 0.6 and, she claims, was consistently reprimanded by Attendo managers. \n Recent weeks have seen a string of reports on harrowing conditions in old-age care homes in Finland, with the private contractors Esperi Care and Attendo accused of running sub-standard services, with the CEO of Esperi Care  quitting  over the scandal. \n Helsinki hotel capacity expands \n Kauppalehti has  good news  for anyone planning a trip to Helsinki: between now and 2021 some 3,000 extra hotel rooms will be added in the capital city region, easing a shortage that had pushed up prices. \n The story, which is based on a real estate consultancy's assessment, suggests that the capital will see around a quarter more hotel rooms enter the market. that is likely to increase competition but also potentially increase tourism in the city. \n There are currently some 9,400 hotel rooms in Helsinki, which according to Statistics Finland were in December running at around 70 percent capacity."}
{"text": "Finnish media has in recent days been aflame with escalating rhetoric about the finer points of constitutional law, thanks to Defence Minister Jussi Niinisto of the Blue Reform Party. \n Helsingin Sanomat  reports  on the spat which started on Tuesday when Niinisto described professor Martin Scheinin’s background in the Communist Party, which the Defence Minister apparently regards as disqualifying. \n “Tweets from admirers of the totalitarian Soviet system cannot in future have significance in Finland’s representative democracy,” wrote Niinisto. \n The issue at hand is ostensibly the decision by parliament to return a much-trailed intelligence law to the committee stage after criticism by constitutional law experts. Scheinin and his fellow professor Juha Lavapuro had previously tweeted criticism of the way lawmakers had ignored criticism from parliament’s constitutional law committee. \n In his blog post Niinisto slammed ‘extra-parliamentary forces’ who want to get their way. \n “Constitutional law Talibs hide their own ideological goals behind a fake cloak of expertise and apply pressure via social media to the democratically elected parliament,” said Niinisto, , whose party is currently polling within the margin of error two months from parliamentary elections due on 14 April. \n On Wednesday Prime Minister Juha Sipila  said  that the tone of the discussion about the intelligence law was ‘approaching the limits’, signalling he may prefer a more constructive approach to parliament’s experts. \n “The government’s job isn’t to direct parliament or the experts called by parliament,” Sipila told journalists. \n Polling pressure \n HS publishes a poll by TNS Kantar today which suggests the Finns Party's support is on the rise. The party fractured in 2017 when hardliner Jussi Halla-aho took over as leader, leading to a dip in support, but the HS poll suggests their support stands at 11.4 percentage points. \n The bigger parties' numbers are down, especially Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's Centre Party, so HS  goes  to his home town of Oulu to see a party meeting to try and find out why. The answer is unambiguous: people like their anti-immigration line, especially in the wake of a spate of sex crimes in which asylum seekers are the suspects. \n Sipilä, remember, famously offered his own home to accommodate refugees in 2015 and the Finns Party faithful believe that has played a role in their current boost in support. \n The group that splintered from the Finns Party, Defence Minister Jussi Niinistö's Blue Reform Party, registered one percentage point in the same poll. \n Bolivian ski star \n Iltalehti  has  a story on Bolivia's distinctly Finnish-sounding cross-country skiing star Timo Grönlund, who is competing in the World Championships in Seefeld this week. Grönlund grew up in Kitee, eastern Finland, before moving to La Paz in 2014 with his Bolivian wife. \n He started gathering points under the Federation International du Ski (FIS) qualification system and, once he passed the threshold to compete in the world championships, the Bolivian ski federation (\"yes, there is one!\" says Timo paid for his trip to Austria. \n It wasn't the most direct route, and it took 36 hours, but it did get him there and he came 29th in the heats, more than four minutes behind the leaders. That's not too bad, concidering how irregularly he gets to ski: he managed a couple of runs in Chile in December, but not much else recently. \n La Paz-based Grönlund does have one trump card, however, in his location. At 3,860 metres above sea level the Bolivian capital is twice as high as many of the camps used for 'altitude training' by endurance skiers."}
{"text": "Finns Party chair Jussi Halla-aho says his party is ready to cooperate as a member of a new coalition government after the upcoming general elections in April. In an appearance on TV1's Ykkösaamu programme on Saturday, the leader of the anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic party said that he felt the Finns Party's inclusion in the new government was \"very important\" as a goal. \n Halla-aho dismissed previous indications that the Social Democratic Party (SDP) would join the National Coalition Party (NCP) and the Centre Party in rejecting the Finns Party as a coalition partner if voted into power. \n \"I would think that these statements are directed to their own vacillating supporters who might be considering a vote for the Finns Party. Their message is 'don't vote for the Finns Party because there will be no government cooperation with them',\" he said. \n \"I wouldn't give too much value to talk like that. At the end of the day, eligibility for government will be determined by the election results and party programmes.\" \n Thrown out of last government after Halla-aho's election \n Halla-aho has set a target that his party's support should increase in the next election from the appropriately 9.6 percent support polls showed the party enjoyed when he  began his stint as party chair in June 2017 . \n \"I've set myself a personal measuring stick that our support has to grow and the number of MPs we have in Parliament must also improve. Otherwise, I don't feel as if I have succeeded in my job,\" he says. \n Centre Party leader and Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and NCP chair and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo promptly  kicked the Finns Party out  of government after hardliner Halla-aho was elected in 2017, a move that was followed by  20-odd Finns Party MPs leaving to form a new party now known as the Blue Reform  that replaced the Finns Party in government. \n \"Moral rot\" in his party is gone \n Halla-aho says that his political party is in better shape now than it was during his predecessor Timo Soini's long reign. \n \"I'm not worried about the future of the party at all anymore. I believe that most Finns Party members would agree that any moral rot or corruption left the party in 2017. Pushiness and ideas of personal gain also went away,\" he said. \n During his television interview, Halla-aho also commented on recent statements from Foreign Minister Timo Soini, who said that acquiring more trained health professionals from the Philippines might be one solution to  understaffing problems  in Finland's care homes. \n \"Filipino nurses can't manage any better in Finland on lower wages than Finnish nurses can. Cheap labour keeps salaries low in these lines of work, and that is the purpose of cheap labour,\" Halla-aho said."}
{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat starts out the day with news of a Eurostat comparison that suggests that  Swedes live about 15 years longer than Finns . Among the EU member states (plus Norway, Iceland and Switzerland), Sweden led \"the number of years a person is expected to live in a healthy condition at birth\" list in 2016 with an age of 73.3 for women and 70.0 for men. Finland's male age of 57 was ranged third from last on the list, ahead of Slovakia and Latvia, and eighth from last for females, at the age of 59.1. \n The EU's statistical body calculated that the EU average was estimated at 64.2 years for women and 63.5 years for men. To reach these numbers, it used information relating to \"healthy life years\" at birth, age 50, and age 65, using mortality statistics and data on self-perceived long-standing activity limitations. \n The self-appraisal asked respondents to answer the question: \"For at least the past six months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities people usually do?\" In Finland, one in three reported some kind of problem. \n Sweden's results indicate that men and women there live 15 more \"healthy life years\" than Finland's residents. HS advises its readers, \"If you want to stay well and keep functional, it would be a good idea to move to Sweden – or at least that's what the EU member state comparison leads us to believe.\" \n Keeping loan companies in check \n The Turku-based newspaper Turun Sanomat reports on  ministerial plans to crack down on payday loans  in Finland. Justice Minister  Antti Häkkinen  is concerned that peddlers of easy credit are growing more aggressive in their advertising, using images of dream vacations to sell loans that often have high interest rates. \n New companies are also entering the Finnish market at a brisk pace. TS points out one new firm, Aurora Laina that set up shop in January of this year. Its advertisement specifically targets people with a bad credit history, offering those that own their own flat a fast loan of between 1,000 and 6,000 euros with a payback time of 1 to 5 years. \n Häkkinen's ministry has put forward a bill to legislate a mandatory cap on interest rates (30 percent) and services fees on loans that would likely come into effect in September, if the Parliament approves it. \n The Bank of Finland calculates that Finnish residents owed 660 million euros to payday loan firms in late 2017, up 52 percent from the previous year, TS reports \n Transport minister opts to leave Parliament \n The Oulu newspaper Kaleva carries an analysis piece this Wednesday on Transport and Communications  Minister  Anne Berner 's announcement that she will not be seeing re-election  at the end of the parliamentary term. \n The paper reports that the Swedish newspaper  Dagens Industri  has indicated that Berner may be moving to the board of the SEB Bank in Sweden. Main owner of the Vallila Interior design company, Berner first gained a seat on Arcadia Hill in 2015, winning close to 10,000 votes in the capital city Uusimaa region. Her appointment to a minister's position already during her first term as MP was seen as highly unorthodox. \n Kaleva says that Finland wasn't ready for a businesswoman with high-flying ideas as minister. Her ambitious project to reform the country's transport infrastructure and introduce private ownership caused friction, while another proposal to eliminate vehicle taxes and set up a road usage fee never even got off the ground. \n Berner has said that both she and her family have had to face intimidation, name-calling and even death threats since she took office. \"I've seen a part of Finland or Finns that I never would have wanted to see or confront,\" she is quoted as saying in her book on leadership that was published last autumn. \n Kaleva says that Berner's Centre Party is probably not too happy about yet another MP voluntarily leaving the ranks before the election. Berner has said in the past that some of the worst opposition to her ministerial efforts came from within her own party."}
{"text": "Parliament met on Tuesday to discuss  a citizens’ initiative aimed at undoing the  Juha Sipilä  government’s activation model , which aims to get unemployed people into jobs. \n Left Alliance MP  Ann Kontula  wasted no time in slamming the empty seats of government MPs who failed to show up for the debate. \n \"From the composition of the hall you can see that everyone knows what’s going on. Everyone knows how embarrassing the activation model is. All the threats that have been embedded in it have come to pass,\" she charged. \n She was not the only lawmaker to comment on the sparse representation of the government side, as shouts of \"Where is the government!\" echoed through the chamber. Government MPs did indeed appear to be missing in action – initially, the only parliamentarians to represent it were Labour Minister  Jari Lindström  and Social Affairs and Health Minister  Pirkko Mattila . \n Many other opposition MPs took turns in condemning the government for its empty benches and speculated that the administration was experiencing pangs of conscience. However as the discussion progressed, National Coalition party MP  Juhana Vartiainen  arrived, followed by the Blue Reform’s  Simo Elo  and  Antti Kaikkonen  of the Centre Party. \n The citizens’ initiative being debated calls on the government to  dismantle the unpopular programme , which requires jobseekers to meet certain conditions or have their unemployment benefits cut. \n Minister admits injustices in model \n The Social Affairs and Health Minister referred to a memo from the Social Affairs and health Committee, which concluded that the activation model has already changed, given that compared to the original proposal, jobseekers  now have additional means of proving  that they are pursuing training or that they are attempting to land a job. \n However Mattila’s comments failed to placate the opposition. \"Humiliating, disrespectful and evil are some of the words used about the activation model,\" said Finns Party MP  Arja Juvonen . \n Pia Viittanen , of the largest opposition party the Social Democrats continued in the same vein. \n \"When this activation model came, I asked ministers why they needed to do this. I remember Minister Lindström, that you said something along the lines of this is just a bitter pill that needed to be swallowed. But surely common sense would prompt you to ask what’s the point of baking a stone in your bun? Everyone will tell you to take the stone out and it will taste better,\" she commented. \n During his speaking turn, Lindström admitted that the scheme contained certain injustices that government had attempted to address. \n “The philosophical question is, ‘what should we replace it with?’ I am confused that on the one hand people are saying that we have to get rid of these cuts. Ok that’s one thing. But then people are saying let’s get rid of the entire model. To replace it with what? Was the philosopher right when he said that you will be punished if you don’t do what needs to be done and you’ll be rewarded if you do? It’s quite clear to me that’s the way it should be,” he said. \n The labour minister repeatedly said that the state-owned research hub VTT was currently assessing the impact of the model and that everyone would be wiser when it completed its work. He added that the government’s aim was not to lay blame on the unemployed. \n Vartiainen stirs up opposition \n The discussion heated up when former state think tank head  Juhana Vartiainen  spoke. He declared that the activation model had proven its functionality since some people had been able to satisfy the conditions for maintaining their benefits  while others hadn’t . \n “If it were the case that all of the unemployed had succeeded in meeting the activation criteria then there would hardly have been any unemployment reduction impact and satisfying the conditions would have been as easy as flipping off the lights,” he remarked. \n He added that the system should not be watered down to allow jobseekers to sign up for any kind of easily- attainable training programme to meet the activation requirements. \n The SDP’s  Antti Lindtman  described Vartiainen’s comments as uncharitable. \n \"But the core of this is that the activation model does not work and it is unjust. It is not right that even the unemployed who are doing the best that can be reasonably be expected and are still not finding work are losing their benefits,\" he observed. \n Silvia Modig  of the Left Alliance said that she was shocked by the government’s view of people. \"The majority of people want to be active, they want a good life for themselves,\" she pointed out. \n \"I can assure representative Modig that my view of people can stand up to scrutiny. I do not think of unemployed people as superfluous or that they can be kicked [around],\" minister Lindström countered. \n The committee report includes dissenting statements from four opposition parties indicating that the government should accept the citizens’ initiative, which proposes terminating the programme. \n MPs will vote on the initiative in the weeks ahead."}

{"text": "Finland's current national debate linking immigration and asylum seekers to crime is simply racist and something that should be stopped, says political commentator  Sini Korpinen . Korpinen joined All Points North to look at the fortunes of the Finns Party offshoot the Blue Reform and their prospects for Finland's upcoming general election. \n Hardliner anti-immigrant MEP  Jussi Halla-aho 's  election to the chair of the nationalist Finns Party in June 2017  rocked the foundation of the government coalition that included the National Coalition Party and the Centre Party. In a bid to maintain their positions in prime minister  Juha Sipilä 's cabinet, several Finns Party MPs and ministers exited the Finns Party to create the Blue Reform. The Blues and the Finns Party each have the 17 seats in Parliament at present, but  their voter support figures couldn't be more different , with the Finns Party polling at around 10 percent to the Blue Reform's one percent. \n Korpinen noted that in spite of its best efforts the Blue Reform may not win more than one or two seats in the April election, and that those MPs are likely to be installed in districts in southern Finland's Uusimaa region. The pundit remarked that the Blues have so far not been able to distinguish themselves from the parent Finns Party, which is clearly anti-immigrant and racist. \n She added that support for the party is likely to come from voters who remain loyal to figures such as Foreign Minister  Timo Soini  and party chair  Sampo Terho . Meanwhile the election may flush out members who want to survive in the cluttered political field by moving to greener pastures such as the NCP, she commented. \n Commenting on the  government's recent move to introduce a civics test for citizenship  as well as similar proposals from the Blues, Helsinki University researcher  Niko Pyrhönen  said that citizenship tests are usually ineffective and that even the native population may not be able to pass them, as has been the case in countries such as the US. Moreover, they are likely to have little effect on curbing crime or immigrant crime, he added. \n Tuition fees, measles and cancer treatment lead the news \n Each week in our podcast we look at the top three news stories that animated our social media audience. This week readers were most drawn to  Monday's press review  which highlighted an article about foreigners and university tuition fees. The former marketing chief behind Angry Birds  Peter Vesterbacka  told the paper that foreign students can help boost Finland's economy, and that Finland could easily attract 150,000 foreign students willing to pay for English-language degree programmes. \n The second most popular story was a recent measles scare that turned out to be a false alarm. In the southern city of Espoo, an  unvaccinated child suspected of carrying the disease had forced a partial shutdown of the Iso Omena shopping centre on Tuesday evening . However, officials later said that the child did not have measles. \n And the third most popular story this week was about a cancer therapy for children suffering from leukemia being piloted in Finland. The treatment - called  CAR-T cell therapy  - involves giving patients genetically modified immune cells which stimulate the immune system. \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

{"text": "The parliamentary constitutional law committee finished its long-awaited report on the latest version of the government's proposed  social, health care and regional government reform  on Friday, calling for many corrections. This means the bill will move to the committee on social affairs and health, which will have little time to execute the required changes before Parliament starts its pre-election recess on 15 March and the government term comes to an end. \n The constitutional law committee is charged with examining the constitutionality of law proposals and their bearing on international human rights. It's unanimous decision on the latest version of the proposed overhaul of Finland's social and health care system and regional government included 20 different requests for \"constitutional law fine-tuning\". \n \"Yes, there's some work that has to be done, but that's why we are here,\" said vice-chair of the constitutional law committee  Tapani Tölli , in a press conference arranged after the report was submitted. \n The report's list requires, for example, a better explanation of customer plans, a re-examination of the timing of regional elections, clearer service requirements for  private facilities , requirements for social and health care quality monitoring, the resolution of some data protection issues, and further clarification of regional  funding  and compensation paid to municipalities. \n Skirting compliance with EU law \n The constitutional law committee also called once again on the  social affairs and health committee  to reconsider so-called EU notification. If member states of the European Union wish to use EU aid, they are required to notify the EU commission. The Finnish government has avoided having to do this, but the committee says that EU commission approval would ensure that the \"freedom of choice\" element of the proposed reform would be compatible with EU competition law. \n The constitutional law committee has struggled with this issue since the first drafts of the proposal were submitted. The report released on Friday contains wording that says that if the social affairs and health committee cannot guarantee the reform's legality in terms of EU law, then the application of the \"freedom of choice\" component of the bill should be postponed. \n The report also calls for the entire regional government component of the bill to also be changed, if it turns out that there is no time to resolve various related issues first. The plan to create larger regions to oversee the administration of the new social and health care system would require that regional funding and municipal taxation are redefined, with a guarantee that regional financing models would ensure that adequate funding is always available to meet social and health service needs. \n Time is running out \n The parliamentary term will end on 15 March already, due to the lead-up to the next general elections on 14 April. This leaves the social affairs and health committee of parliament with just a few weeks to implement the changes in Friday's report. The committee has already called an extraordinary meeting on Monday to go through the report. \n \"We'll do what we can. We need guidance from the government about what our next course of action should be: which details should be changed and how they want to proceed,\" said  Krista Kiuru , chair of the committee. \n Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services  Annika Saarikko  says her ministry will start in on the work required immediately. \n \"We've got some sweaty weeks ahead, but I am hopeful that we can work together with the civil service to come up with solutions to all of the points that the social affairs and health committee requests,\" she said. \n Opposition: The game is over \n Opposition leaders commented on the report and its ramifications on social media on Friday. \n \"Not only does the constitutional law committee require that the social affairs and health committee ensure EU law compliance, but it also calls for the 'adoption of the freedom of choice law to be postponed'. In practice, the social affairs and health committee cannot guarantee this without significantly altering the bill,\" Left Alliance Chair  Li Andersson  posted on Twitter. \n \"My personal conclusion: this is the end of the line. It's high time the government blew the whistle – time is out and the game is over. The problems of the model are just too great and there's no way we can confirm its relationship to EU law with this little time left. We should spend our time thinking about what to do moving forward instead.\" she tweeted later. \n Green chair  Pekka Haavisto  called for a meeting of all the parliamentary parties to discuss the bill's current status. \n \"The changes required by the constitutional law committee are significant. It looks quite likely that implementation of the sote reform will transfer to the next term,\" he tweeted. \n The Swedish People's Party chair  Anna-Maja Henriksson  appeared in an Yle interview Saturday morning to say that the reform will not be finished in time for a vote this term, as there are too many outstanding problems."}
{"text": "Finland's President  Sauli Niinistö  will have a hip operation on Wednesday, according to the president's office. \n Despite the surgery, Niinistö is expected to be able to perform his duties as usual during his recuperation, according to his office. \n However, the president will not be able to travel by air for at least a month. \n The president's office announced last May that Niinistö suffers from osteoarthritis, a degenerative condition which - in this case - can wear away cartilage in the hip joint. \n According to information from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, cartilage affected by osteoarthritis becomes frayed and rough, sometimes causing damaged bones to form bone spurs.

He added that he was not concerned about having a convicted man represent the party. \n \"If it were a question of a murderer or a thief the situation would be completely different. The court case is quite unusual. I don't see that it would be an obstacle to [his] candidacy,\" he observed. \n Last October, the Helsinki District Court sentenced the immigrant agitator Janitskin to 22 months in jail after finding him guilty of  16 criminal charges  related to his websites. \n The charges included aggravated defamation, aggravated incitement against an ethnic group and copyright infringement, among others. \n The court also ordered Janitskin to pay the lion's share of a reported 200,000 euros in damages to harassment victims after he,  Johan Bäckman  and another individual were found guilty of harassing and defaming Yle journalist  Jessikka Aro  and inciting others to defame her. \n Bäckman is a Finnish academic known  known for publicly championing Russian child custody rights abroad. \n Politician with communist past also running \n Another addition to the Seven Star Movement's roster, veteran politician  Pirjo Turpeinen-Saari , made her first formal appearance during Tuesday's press conference since announcing last week that she's also running for the Finnish and EU parliaments on the party ticket. \n Turpeinen-Saari, a child psychologist, lives in southern Finland's region of Raseborg but will aiming for a lawmaker's seat as a Helsinki candidate. \n Turpeinen-Saari served as MP in 1983-1986 as a member of the political group the Finnish People's Democratic League (SDKL), an organisation regarded by many at the time as a communist front. \n The group was one of the largest  leftist  parties in western  Europe . In its heyday, the Finnish Communist Party was the SDKL's main member party, and one of the biggest communist parties west of the Iron Curtain. \n Then, in 1986-1987 Turpeinen-Saari served as MP for the communist breakaway group the Democratic Alternative and was married to the former chair of Finland's Communist Party  Jouko Kajanoja  from 1985-1996. \n Turpeinen-Saari has also written several books, including one in 1986 about the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. \n In a more recent book published in 2016, she accused Finland's military leader  Carl Gustaf Emil  Mannerheim **  of having inflamed the conflict between Finland and the Soviet Union into war in 1939."}
{"text": "Finland elects a new Parliament once every four years, and on 14 April 2019, voters will once again choose 200 Members of Parliament to govern the country. \n The party that gains the most votes in the election gets to name the Prime Minister, who then picks a cabinet of ministers from the crowd of newly-elected MPs. This coalition runs the country on a day-to-day basis for as long as they enjoy the confidence of the majority of parliament, or until the next election. \n The current three-party government coalition is led by Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party, with the National Coalition Party (NCP) and the Blue Reformparty also holding ministerial posts in the cabinet. Those parties currently control 104 of the 200 seats in the Finnish parliament. \n This is a thin majority for a country used to relatively broad-based coalitions; the previous government elected in 2011 included six of the then-eight parties in parliament. \n The government would need at least a simple majority to be able to implement its legislative programme.  Lasse Isokangas / Yle Uutisgrafiikka \n The current three-party coalition has been more ideologically coherent, with market-based reforms and austerity dominating the agenda. The Sipilä government took office in 2015 pledging four billion euros in  annual spending cuts , including reducing outlays on education and social security. The government also pushed through a measure to make most people in the country work an extra 22.5 hours a year, while adding restrictions on unemployment benefits. \n The April election could see a big shift in policy if Sipilä and his Centre Party do not do well enough for him to continue as premier. \n What are the issues? \n The government’s  controversial and unfinished reform of health and social care (‘sote’)  is one of the biggest issues facing the country, but few voters fully understand the complex proposal. \n This reform aims to bring in private providers and move responsibility for care from municipalities to new regional authorities, but it remains unclear if there is majority support in parliament for the plan, as the opposition parties and even  some government party MPs  have indicated that they are unwilling to vote for it. Constitutional and EU compliance issues have also bogged down the bill in committees, repeatedly delaying a parliamentary vote. \n A spate of recent scandals about  standards at care homes  has pushed that issue to the top of the political agenda, ensuring that parties are now discussing tightening the rules for operators of facilities for the elderly. \n After recent alarming news about climate change, the Green Party is framing this year's vote as the last chance to save the world,  hoping for a ‘climate election’ , while the nationalist Finns Party is pushing to make immigration a central theme of the election campaign, especially after a  series of sexual abuse cases in Oulu  in which the suspects were asylum seekers or immigrants. \n Who’s likely to win? \n The largest opposition party in the last term, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), has been  leading public opinion polls  and hopes to emerge from the election as the party with the most votes. Party chair  Antti Rinne  has returned to the campaign trail after a recent  illness . \n If they succeed in this endeavour, the SDP is likely to look to the Green Party as a potential coalition partner, as well as the Left Alliance. These three parties have been consistent critics of the current government’s austerity budgets and labour market reforms. \n Polling numbers have been steadily rising for the Greens in Finland, and they hope to achieve the same kind of status as the 'big three' parties of Finnish politics (the SDP, NCP and Centre). After a recent dip in support, they changed leaders, electing  former presidential candidate   Pekka Haavisto  as their new party chair. \n Those three parties are unlikely to make up the required 101 MP seats on their own, however, and so the NCP or Centre Party may also be asked to join the new administration, along with a smaller party like the Swedish People's Partyorthe Christian Democratic Party.Even the conservative Blue Reform party, a new political party that split from the Finns Party in 2017, might be a contender. \n The winning parties are likely to face  tough choices  in creating a working coalition, however, as the electoral arithmetic might not throw up an obvious, ideologically-coherent combination. \n President Sauli Niinistö is not up for re-election. Florian Wieser / EPA \n What about President Niinistö? \n Finland’s  popular president   Sauli Niinistö , who  brought together Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin last year , is not up for re-election, having won a second term in 2018. His role is in foreign policy and diplomacy, and he is constitutionally prohibited from interfering in domestic politics. \n It is unlikely any coalition government would have big disagreements with Niinistö, who has been president  since 2012  and was formerly a member of the National Coalition party. \n What happens next? \n Coalition negotiations can drag on. In 2011 it took  more than two months  from election to confirmation of  Jyri Katainen  as Prime Minister. \n Horsetrading and political wrangling aside, it's a big year for elections in Finland. New MEPs are due to be elected on 26 May, and new regional assemblies may (or may not) be elected as part of the troubled ‘sote’ reform. \n A recent economic upswing might well run out of steam in the coming years, leaving the incoming administration less room to manoeuvre than they might like. \n Lasse Isokangas / Yle Uutisgrafiikka \n A really simple guide to the main parties \n The  Centre Party  is a centrist party that enjoys strong voter support in the countryside. It has liberal and traditionalist wings. The centre-right  National Coalition  is an economically liberal party that is popular in cities and among higher-income groups. The  Blue Reform  split from the Finns Party after a hardliner took over as party chair in June 2017. The coalition partners objected and kicked the Finns Party out of government, but eventually accepted the Blue Reform ministers and MPs who broke with the Finns Party back into the coalition. The  Finns Party  is a right-wing populist party that is opposed to immigration and the EU. The  Social Democratic Party  is a centre-left party with strong links to Finland's trade unions. The  Green Party  is an environment-focused party founded in the 1970s with a growing supporter base among young, urban voters. The  Left Alliance  is a left-wing group with roots in the Communist party and strong links to the labour movement.

{"text": "The Swedish People's Party (SPP) has been part of different coalition governments for close to 40 years, but since 2015 it has been relegated to the opposition. A prominent supporter of Swedish-language rights and interests in Finland, the SPP has traditionally received the support of Finland's Swedish-speaking minority, which makes up about five percent of the population. \n This week's APN asked journalist  Sam Kingsley  and political commentator  Sini Korpinen  about the prospects for the SPP now that the Swedish-speaking voter base is shrinking. \n Kingsley and Korpinen said that the party's unclear platform and apparent unwillingness to take strong stands on several recent controversial issues is proof that it is looking to keep its options open, in terms of potential future coalition cooperation. \n Yle's  latest poll  put SPP support at around four percent. Party chair  Anna-Maja Henriksson  has said she hopes the party will gain 11 seats in the April elections, two more seats than the party holds now. \n Turku University researcher  Matti Välimäki  also contributed to the conversation, noting that SPP has profiled itself as a pro-immigration party. He said in addition to SPP's support for European integration, that effectively means joining a coalition with the anti-immigrant Finns Party would be impossible. \n Cannabis, conscription and a mosque attack top the news  \n Every Friday in our podcast, we take a look at the most popular stories of the past week. This week, Yle News readers were drawn to a report about commercial  gardeners in Finland hoping to make medicinal cannabis the country's next big export hit . Their announcement came on the heels of a recent decision made by the EU last month to distinguish medicinal cannabis from other uses of the plant. Currently, growing cannabis under any circumstances is illegal in Finland. \n The next-most popular story was a report about Parliament  overturning a law that previously allowed male Jehovah's Witness members to skip military or civilian service without facing penalties.  The exemption had been in effect since 1987 and has long been controversial. Last year, the Helsinki Court of Appeal ruled that the Finnish practice of allowing male Jehovah's Witnesses to avoid conscription was discriminatory. \n And finally, our readers were drawn to a story about  a smoke bomb being thrown through the window of an Islamic prayer room in the city of Oulu . Imam  Abdul Mannan  said that the attack was the ninth time that the facility had been vandalised within the past year. Oulu is currently home to an estimated 3,000 Muslims. The city has recently been dealing with a number of  suspected child sex abuse  cases allegedly carried out by individuals from the Middle East. \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind with All Points North, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

However he left the door open to a possible European Parliament bid in May. \n Soini made the announcement in his blog on Tuesday, the last possible day to register as a candidate for next month's Finnish election. \n He said he will support the fledgling Blue Reform party in its campaign ahead of  the election on 14 April . In his post, Soini does not mention a possible bid to return to the European Parliament, writing only of beginning a \"new journey after this stint as an MP\". \n Possible candidates for the European Parliament elections have until late April to register, a month before the 26 May poll. \n Soini's decision is likely to have a major impact on the Blue Reform's chances in this spring's two elections.

{"text": "The opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) continues to consolidate support among voters just one month ahead of parliamentary  elections due in Finland next month , according to a fresh test of voter sentiment. \n Backing for the parliament's largest opposition group rose by 1.2 percentage-points from  a previous poll in February  and now stands at 21.3 percent, outstripping government coalition partners the National Coalition Party (NCP) and Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party. \n Voter approval for the NCP fell just over one percentage point to 16.2 percent, the party's weakest performance in four years and the lowest during  Petteri Orpo 's chairmanship. Sipilä's Centre also posted a dubious distinction, with voter support slipping 1.5 percentage points since February to 14.1 percent, the lowest recorded by pollster Taloustutkimus since November 2011. \n The SDP's lead over the NCP is now 5.1 percentage points and it is 7.2 percentage points ahead of the Centre. \n Pre-election boost for Finns Party \n The populist Finns Party posted the biggest gains in Yle's latest poll, capturing the approval of 13.3 percent of voters and building up momentum that began earlier this year and racking up the highest level of approval under  new chair, the immigration hardliner   Jussi Halla-aho . This month's support reflects an increase of 1.3 percentage points over the last survey. \n \"People who had previously voted for the Finns Party and who have occasionally been doubtful [about the party] are now restoring their support,\" said Taloustutkimus research director  Tuomo Turja . \n Before the latest voter survey, the immigration- and EU-sceptic party had been nearly neck-and-neck with the Left Alliance, but it is now challenging the Greens for the position of the country's fourth-most-popular party. \n Meanwhile the Greens, led by  former minister and presidential candidate   Pekka Haavisto , lost nearly a full percentage point of voter sentiment to settle at 13.7 percent backing, while the Left Alliance enjoyed a very marginal boost to register 8.9 percent support. \n Among the smaller parliamentary groups,  the Swedish People's Party  saw support rise to 4.7 percent. Approval for  the Christian Democrats  remained more or less steady at 3.5 percent. The  Blue Reform , which split from the Finns Party two years ago, seems to have failed to capture the imagination of voters, with support languishing at just 1.8 percent in the latest survey. \n NCP bleeding votes to Finns Party, Centre voters abandoning ship \n With undecided or floating voters switching allegiances in the run-up to the 14 April election, anything is still possible. Pollster Turja said that the survey's background data indicate that the Finns Party has managed to attract voters from the sidelines as well as from other parties. \n \"The NCP and the Centre are most clearly losing [support] to the Finns Party,\" he added. \n However the majority of NCP deserters have fled to the Greens, while Centre voters are jumping ship to join a range of other parties, including \"the Greens, the Finns Party, the NCP and the SDP...undecided voters are now a challenge for the Centre,\" Turja remarked. \n One interesting feature of the SDP's performance is not only its high approval rating during the survey period, but also the return of party leader  Antti Rinne  from an extended period of sick leave. Last Friday,  Rinne relieved vice chair   Sanna Marin , who has been  substituting as interim chair  during his absence. The final survey interviews were conducted on Monday and Tuesday, after Rinne's return. \n \"This was clearly the weakest period for the SDP in the survey period,\" Turja pointed out. \n SDP and Greens would grab most additional seats \n Taloustutkimus voter surveys for Yle have made estimates of the number of parliamentary seats parties would have relative to their current representation, based on a calculation of a six-month average of voter support. The calculus indicates that if an election were held now, Orpo's National Coalition would secure four additional seats for a total of 41 MPs in Parliament, although voter support now is significantly lower than during the 2015 general election. \n The data show however, that the SDP and the Greens would post the biggest gains in the legislature. The SDP would nab 15 additional seats, bringing its present complement to 49, while the Greens would add 11 more MPs to seat 26 representatives. \n On the flip side of the coin, if voters went to the polls today, the Centre Party would see its number of MPs plummet from 49 to 36.

{"text": "Green MEP  Heidi Hautala  has come under fire for what some perceive as her attempt to attenuate a proposed European Parliament resolution calling for asset freezes and visa denials for more than 30 Russian nationals believed to have played a role in the death of anti-corruption lawyer  Sergei Magnitsky. \n An  article by the online publication the  Daily Beast  referred to leaked emails in which Hautala reportedly lashed out at what she allegedly termed Europe's \"obsession\" with \"targetting\" Russian President  Vladimir Putin . It also quoted unnamed sources accusing the Green MEP of opposing the mention of Magnitsky's name in the resolution. \n Petri Sarvamaa , a conservative National Coalition Party MEP and former Yle reporter, commented on the  Daily Beast  article, which takes Hautala to task for allegedly pandering to the interests of Russia. Sarvamaa said in a tweet on Wednesday that he couldn't comment on Hautala's motives for her position on the resolution. \n \"I can only confirm that with respect to the matter of naming Magnitsky, Hautala actively pulled in the same direction as the Kremlin,\" he declared in the same tweet. \n \"I mean that it is not in the Kremlin's interests for Magnitsky to be associated with human rights in EU regulations. Russia does not like the EU talking about him,\" Sarvamaa told Yle. \n \"I absolutely do not claim that she is consciously seeking Russia's interests. I only said that in this matter, she [appeared to have] a common interest. I don't know her motives or why she has been so energetic about it,\" he continued. \n Hautala: \"My position is clear\" \n Hautala has disputed the accusations reported in the  Daily Beast  that she was playing up to Russia, stressing that she supports the resolution. \n \"My position is extremely clear: I fully support the EU's personal sanctions for human rights violations,\" she told Yle. \n Hautala is one of three MEPs from the Green bloc in the European Parliament who have tabled objections to the proposal. \n \"EU directives are not named after private individuals,\" she declared. \n Sanctioning human rights violations \n Magnitsky was a Russian anti-corruption lawyer specialising in accounting who died in police custody in 2009. Legislation named after him in the US imposes sanctions against Russians suspected of playing a role in his death. \n The Netherlands has suggested that the EU should also introduce similar regulations to apply sanctions in the event of human rights violations. An official working group is currently considering the issue. \n The European Parliament's resolution aims to support these efforts. However no progress has yet been made in drawing up draft regulations. \n MEP Sarvamaa said that any proposed directive should specifically mention Magnitsky, although the regulations would not exclusively target Moscow, but would be applied to similar human rights abuses. \n \"It would mostly draw attention and it would send a strong signal from the EU because this is such an infamous case internationally,\" Sarvamaa added. \n Magnitsky was working for an investment fund run by the US-born financier and economist  Bill Browder  when he was arrested by Russian authorities. Since Magnitsky's death, Browder has campaigned to have similar laws introduced in different countries. \n Browder took note of Hautala's objections to naming the resolution after Magnitsky and also took to Twitter to call her out for her position."}

{"text": "Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori says that he is relieved to hear that the government’s  package of social and healthcare reforms  will not be passed after the government  resigned on Friday . Vapaavuori has long been a critic of the reform, which would have diverted resources from the capital to other regions, but says that the constitutional issues with the legislation were the biggest red flag. \n “I have consistently said it was clear that it would fail,” said Vapaavuori on Friday. “And that for several weeks everyone who can read the constitution has realised that it would fail. But it’s good that we can draw a line under this failed exercise.” \n The National Coalition politician said that he felt the package, which combined a major expansion of private sector involvement with an entirely new layer of regional government, was simply too big to pass and that ‘megareforms’ would be off the agenda for a while. \n “Now we surely understand that we don’t need to get into a panic and build new models, but that we should carefully analyse what has happened and why it went like this,” said Vapaavuori. “Then we’ll calmly take steps in the right direction.” \n The mayor, who repeatedly  joined forces with other municipal leaders  from larger towns and cities to criticise the reforms, said the government was too stubborn in trying to force through its model and that ‘not even the fourth proposal was even close to being constitutional’. \n He denied, however, that this was a personal victory. \n “I think the Finnish people have won,” said Vapaavuori. “As we won’t have a reform that would have taken the country backwards, more towards the past than the future, against all trends in the global economy.”"}
{"text": "Both the government and 'sote', the long-planned social and health care reform  ran aground in Finland on Friday , and many people are concerned about what this means moving forward. The public broadcaster Yle answered eight common questions it has been fielding from the public after the news broke. \n 1. Who's running the country now? \n A caretaker government . Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä  and his government have been asked by the Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  to  continue in office in a caretaker capacity  until the next government takes office. This means the same ministers will continue in their work, but their powers will be reduced. The caretaker government will handle the day-to-day matters of running the state, but will be unable to start any new projects, for example, due to its diminished mandate. Sipilä's Centre Party-National Coalition Party-Blue Reform coalition would have assumed this role anyway after the general elections on 14 April, until the new government is formed. \n 2. How will this affect the upcoming elections? \n Not at all . The elections will take place as scheduled on 14 April. The processing of candidate applications has already begun and the electoral authorities have begun their preparations. Because there are only five weeks left until the elections, there is no reason to appoint a new government. Read our  really simple guide to the 2019 parliamentary elections  for more information. \n 3. How will the failure of the 'sote' project affect social and health care services? \n Not at all . The fact that the government was unable to see its reform over the finish line will not affect services in any way. Everything will continue as it has been in the past, including in hospital districts where cooperation models and trials have been started. \n 4. And what was 'sote' again? \n A project to reform Finland's social and health care system . Finnish politicians have been talking about 'so-te' (a name taken from the Finnish words for social and health) for so long that its meaning has become obscure. Sote refers to the Finnish government's push to reorganize and streamline social and health care services under a new tier of regional government. Sipilä's is the third consecutive government to have attempted the sweeping overhaul unsuccessfully, although his coalition made considerably more progress than his predecessors. Read our  'sote' explainer from 2017  to learn more. \n 5. Will all the 'sote' reform work now go down the drain?  \n No , the next government will likely pick up where the Sipilä coalition left off, using many elements of the plan and perhaps discarding other controversial components like the 'freedom of choice' option that would have opened the public services up to more private company competition. \n 6. How much has preparation of the sote bill cost? \n Hundreds of millions of euros , according to most estimates. The total cost of the extensive bill's preparation has been difficult to calculate, as the groundwork has extended to many sectors and regions. \n 7. Is there a chance the next government will cancel the 'sote' reform altogether? \n Not likely . The prevailing notion in Finland is that the current municipally-run system of social and health care is too expensive in light of an aging population. A new model must be introduced to consolidate services and make them more cost-efficient, the thinking goes. As pundit  Sini Korpinen  said in Yle News's All Points North  podcast  on Friday, it is likely that we have not seen the last of 'sote'. \n 8. Was this government resignation an election stunt? \n Possibly . Prime Minister Juha Sipilä emphasized in his Friday press conference that the dissolution of his government was a \" personal decision \". Yle's political analyst  Matti Koivisto  says that  polling  was suggesting dismal election results for Sipilä's Centre party, so the premier had nothing to lose. The  reaction of many opposition party representatives  indicates that they believe the move was a stunt, inspired by pre-election panic."}
{"text": "Finland's Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä   dissolved his government  on Friday, but at the request of the President, his coalition will continue as a  caretaker government  until 14 April. This means that he and his ministers will continue to handle the day-to-day matters of running the state, but will have a  diminished mandate . This new role will prohibit the government from starting any new initiatives or making any high-profile appointments. \n Normally, the government of Finland is charged with officially naming the heads of civil servant organizations. The only exception is defence ministry officers, who are normally named by the president. \n An important post that is still unfilled is the future Intelligence Ombudsman of Finland who will preside over civilian and military intelligence. Finland's security and intelligence authorities will likely soon see their intelligence-gathering and surveillance powers expanded, as the Finnish Parliament is expected to pass  legislation  to grant them  broader powers  in this area. \n The justice ministry's administrative director  Olli Muttilainen  says that if the caretaker government cannot carry out the appointment, it will likely fall on the next government to do it, which would likely delay the naming until next summer. \n \"It will be a relatively long delay,\" he said. \n The Parliament's constitutional law committee issued a statement earlier this week that recommended  Kimmo Hakonen , general secretary of the Chancellor of Justice's office management, for the position. \n Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  is also expected to name a new Defence Commander to replace  Jarmo Lindberg  who will be stepping down when his term ends. This appointment was also expected sometime during March, but may also be delayed."}
{"text": "Caretaker Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä  told Yle on Saturday that he will not seek re-election as chair if support for the Centre Party doesn’t rise. \n Sipilä told Yle’s Ykkösaamu interview programme that he will not seek a second term at the party’s helm if the election result shows that the party has not been able to boost support from the  14.1-percent voter approval recorded in Yle’s latest survey . \n \"It is quite clear that I will not be a candidate in Vantaa with that kind of result,\" Sipilä said, referring to the party’s 2020 convention due to take place in Vantaa. \n \"Of course the election result will influence whether or not I think I have the right to continue as party leader. Voters and party supporters also want to see results from the chairman in an election,\" the prime minister added. \n On Friday, Sipilä  tendered his administration’s resignation  to President  Sauli Niinistö , citing the failure of its signature social and health care reform programme. At the time he said that his government operated on the \"show results or go home\" principle. \n In spite of the dramatic start to the day on Friday, Sipilä was visible in a number of campaign events in the Häme region in southern Finland. However at that time he did not comment on whether or not he would be available to chair the party after  elections due on 14 April. \n Sleepless nights, but \"no regrets\" \n Sipilä told Yle that while he did not sleep very well on Friday night, he stands by his decision to tender the government’s resignation as the right one. \n \"Without a doubt I stayed awake last night. I have no regrets. I think the decision was the right one. You have to be able to draw conclusions. I’m very comfortable with the outcome,\" he added. \n He revealed that on Thursday night, the Centre Party convened a meeting in which the group discussed the fate of the reform package and the continuation of the government under the circumstances. Sipilä stressed that  the decision to resign was entirely his  and not the party’s. \n The Centre head said that the failure to see the reform package into the goal meant that he went to see the President at his Mäntyniemi residence  as a failed premier . \n He denied that the decision to quit had anything to do with the party’s  poor performance in voter approval surveys  ahead of the approaching election. Sipilä insisted that he would have done the same regardless of the time frame. \n \"I would have done the same, even if 'sote' [social and health care reform] had failed in November.\" \n Sipilä’s government coalition partners,  Petter Orpo  of the National Coalition Party and  Sampo Terho  of the Blue Reform said on Friday that they would have not scuppered the government, had they found themselves in the same position. \n Opposition to blame for failed reform \n Sipilä insisted that in the end, the ambitious plan to overhaul social and health care services did not stumble over the constitution or shortcomings in the government’s proposals, but over resistance from the opposition. \n \"The opposition has wanted to do this for the entire term [in office]. There has been immense pushback.\" \n Asked why the government did not table proposals that complied with the constitution, Sipilä said that the issue was not the proposals’ unconstitutionality, but a question of interpretation of the constitution. \n \"Based on their preparation, the [reform] proposals were constitutional,\" Sipilä asserted, referring to plans to increase the role of private sector providers in the social and health care system. \n The corporatisation element has been included in the model in 2016, and was selected in part because  it would not require filing a \"notification\" for the EU to assess  the measure. When the corporatisation model, tanked the issue of notification reared its head once more. \n \"The constitution is constantly being interpreted,\" he noted. \n \"The model is continuously changing. We have done our best and listened to the expert. This certainly would have been completed if we had a little more time,\" Sipilä added. \n The PM declared that the derailment of the reform programme will have costly consequences. So far, it has cost the public purse up to 300 million euros. \n \"This also means that for public finances, curbing spiralling [social and health care] costs will be postponed.\" \n Meanwhile some local governments have already started outsourcing their health care centres to private players. Sipilä predicted that the trend is likely to continue. \"There will be serious consequences,\" he reiterated."}
{"text": "Helsinki deputy mayor  Nasima Razmyar  says she is concerned about the \"alternate reality\" that some immigrant groups occupy. Speaking to  tabloid daily Ilta-Sanomat , Razmyar referenced a  Helsinki stabbing attack  just over one week ago, in which two adults and three children were injured, and where  the assailant is still on the run . \n IS writes that the assault is believed to be linked to \"honour violence\". The 33-year-old suspect,  Hayder Al-Hmedav , had reportedly threatened his former wife with disfigurement because she had gone out in public without a veil. \n Razmyar told IS that it is important to take this kind of \"alternate reality\" in the capital area seriously. \"A large majority of immigrants and asylum seekers understand what integrating into a new society means. We still have a small minority that wants to live according to their own norms, to try crimes themselves and to hand down judgments in their own courts,\" she declared. \n \"A huge number of ethnic communities act as bridge builders to Finnish society, but a small number build walls instead,\" she added. \n Razmyar said that one challenge that some immigrant women face is that they do not have the courage to speak to the authorities. Another issue is that the authorities do not take threats women receive seriously or they do not understand the situation. \n MPs cosying up to voters? \n MPs will gather on Tuesday to consider a bill that aims to eliminate  parachute pensions for lawmaker s. Hot off the presses in Turku, southwest Finland,  Turun Sanomat writes that the term  \"adjustment pension\" is itself a misnomer for the perk, since many who receive it have not reached retirement age. \n In Finland, former MPs in Finland are entitled to adjustment pensions if they were elected to Parliament before 2011 and have served for at least seven years. On average, adjustment pensions amount to about 3,000 euros per month. \n The draft legislation was prompted by  a citizens' initiative that gathered support  from 70,000 signatories, propelling it to Parliament in spring 2018. The initiative has proceeded through parliament along with a similar proposal drawn up by lawmakers themselves. \n According to TS, there is broad support for the draft legislation although it will sharply reduce the income they receive from the parliamentary careers. TS speculated that one reason for the apparent enthusiasm is an attempt to curry favour with voters ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections. \n The first reading of the bill takes place on Tuesday, with MPs likely to vote on the measure on Wednesday. A crucial second reading is then likely to take place next Monday or Tuesday. \n Violence increasingly seen as a means of influence \n Terrorism, climate change and global politics have contributed to a heightened sense of insecurity among young people in Finland, according to a new youth survey. \n Leading circulation daily  Helsingin Sanomat reports Tuesday  that more than three-quarters of respondents in the annual poll said that they felt somewhat more or very much more insecure or uncertain about climate change. Ten years ago, climate change was a headline concern for 40 percent of respondents to a similar survey. \n All the same, a clear majority of the 1,900-odd interviewees said they were optimistic about their personal outlook as well as that of the country, although there was a slight increase in uncertainty about the future of the world. \n The survey revealed increasing interest in politics among 15 - 29-year-olds, indicating steady growth since the 1990s. Two-thirds of young people told researchers  Elina Pekkarinen  and  Sami Myllyniemi  that they were either somewhat or highly interested in politics. The research pair attributed the outcome to rising concerns about the climate. \n However although young people may be paying more attention to politics, they said they have less faith in politicians, with one-third of survey participants declaring that politicians are unreliable. At the same time, confidence in political parties was found to be lower than in other societal institutions. Trust in the office of the president, however, rose sharply during President  Sauli Niinistö 's term to reach 93 percent in the 2018 survey. \n HS reported that the researchers also found it worrying that more young people see violence as an increasingly effective means of creating impact, compared to previous barometers -- nearly one in ten said they believed it is possible to use violence to make a major difference."}
{"text": "The Finns Party has become as well known for controversy as it has for what it calls its scepticism of immigration and the EU. A recent Yle poll  shows the populist party gaining momentum  in the run-up to the April general election. \n The party appears to have bounced back from the internal division that saw the Blue Reform breakaway to return to the  Juha Sipilä  administration, which said it was not prepared to work with a Finns Party led by immigration hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho. \n APN looked at the pitched battle for poll position with political commentator  Sini Korpinen  and AFP journalist  Sam Kingsley.  Taloustutkimus researcher  Tuomas Turja  also shared his analysis on the party's 13.3-percent polling in Yle's latest political survey. According to Turja, the Finns Party is known for rapidly gaining ground ahead of parliamentary elections to post big gains among voters at the ballot. \n Finns Party among the \"big three\"? \n Korpinen agreed, saying that in her view, the nationalist group is still to reach its peak and will continue to improve in the polls until the election. She predicted that it would not be far-fetched for them to even rise to the ranks of the \"big three\" after the vote. Journalist Sam Kingsley agreed, noting that the \"immigration-sceptic\" party may have been provided with \"a gift\" in the form of heavy media coverage of suspected sexual abuse in the northern city of Oulu. \n Kingsley also referred to a recent Turku University study indicating that nowadays Finns Party voters are more educated, middle-income earners worried that they have more to lose and are consequently concerned about immigration. Both pundits agreed that if the party does end up in government, as  chair Halla-aho has said is his wish , it will likely struggle to maintain \"street cred\" as it did during its previous turn in the Sipilä administration. \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

{"text": "The political party that Finnish residents would most like to see as part of the new government is the Social Democrats, according to a  recent poll  conducted by the Foundation for Municipal Development, an interest group that looks after the best interests of Finland's over 300 municipalities. \n Close to half, or 45 percent, of the survey's over one thousand respondents said they would like to see the SDP in the next coalition. The next most popular were the Greens with 35 percent support, followed by the National Coalition Party (NCP) and the Centre Party, who were tied with just slightly over 30 percent support each. \n Support for Finns Party in government up \n The only party whose support in the poll increased from a similar poll the municipal group conducted last summer was the Finns Party. Now the survey showed that just under a fifth of the respondents would like to see the Finns Party have a role in government. \n Voters who plan to vote for the SDP, Greens or Left Alliance answered that they would prefer to see a coalition of these three players in government for the next four years. In contrast, supporters of the Finns Party in the poll were unable to indicate even one party that they would like to see in government with their party representatives. \n The survey was carried out by the pollster Kantar TNS, reaching out to 1,112 respondents that represented 18 to 79 year olds in all corners of mainland Finland. The margin of error for the results is less than three percentage points in either direction. \n Yle also did its own assessment this week about which parties would be willing to work with which others, based on responses to its  election compass . \n The SDP came out on top of this assessment, too, as the most desirable coalition partner. The NCP and the Centre Party candidate responses indicated that neither would rank the other as the number one partner in a potential future government."}
{"text": "The news agency STT approached several environmental organisations and specialists about how Finland's main political parties differ in the  pre-election  solutions they are offering to tackle climate change. \n The experts agree that none of the parliamentary parties seem to understand how quickly new policies must be enacted in order to avoid  dire consequences . \n The panel advises voters that are concerned about climate change to first compare the parties' goals for achieving carbon neutrality in Finland. Attaining a net zero carbon footprint would require lowering overall carbon dioxide emission levels to equal carbon removal capacity. Finland's vast forests already provide a sizeable carbon sink, but other measures such as carbon offsetting and increased renewable energy are also important in this effort. \n Different carbon neutral target dates \n STT's experts say the parties' projected carbon neutral dates are a good indicator of their willingness to forsake fossil fuels and peat, for example. \n The Greens pledge that they want Finland to be carbon neutral by 2030, while the Social Democrats (SDP) and the Swedish People's Party (SPP) have set a target of 2035. \n The centre-right National Coalition Party (NCP) says it wants to make fossil fuels a thing of the past \"sometime in the 2030s\", while the Centre Party has set a target date of 2045. \n The Left Alliance is also ambitious, saying that they want to \"make Finland carbon-negative by the early 2030s\". \n Carbon neutrality target dates are conspicuously missing in the election platforms of the Christian Democrats, the Blue Reform and the Finns Party. \n Few clear plans and exact percentages  \n Environmental rights researcher  Heta Heiskanen  of the University of Tampere says a second important target for eco-conscious citizens to analyse is the emission reduction percentage that political parties state in their manifestos. \n For example, the Greens call for 60 percent reductions, while the NCP calls for an increase in the 2030 EU emissions reduction target to 55 percent from its current 40 percent, compared with 1990 levels. Many of the remaining parties, like the SDP, Centre and the Left Alliance, pledge that they would like to see emission reduction percentages increased, but without stating specific numbers. \n Another thing the experts say voters can follow is whether the parties have clear plans in place to make attainment of these targets possible. \n \"Ask yourself whether they are speaking of larger entities and significant political policies, or if they seem bogged down in discussions of the little details,\" says project manager  Janne Peljo  of the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra. \n Lack of understanding about the means towards the end \n Before Christmas, eight of the nine parliamentary parties in Finland sat down to compose a  joint statement  that said the country must play its part in limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. However, according to the experts that spoke with STT, the parties do not necessarily understand the means required to make good on this commitment. \n Mia Rahunen , a climate expert at WWF Finland, points out that this promise can't be kept without eliminating the use of fossil fuels. She too feels that none of the party manifestos seem to reveal a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the situation. \n The parties show clear differences when it comes to laying out specific courses of action, the STT experts say. For example, the Greens, Left Alliance, SPP and SDP each have clear action points to tackle climate change in their election manifestos, while the NCP and Centre Party sections on the environment raise many questions. \n \"When it comes to the former government coalition parties in particular, it is tough [to understand their climate goals]. They seem to say one thing and do another,\" says  Olli Tiainen , climate and energy campaigner and project leader at Greenpeace Nordic. \n Tampere University's Heiskanen agrees that it is difficult to ascertain the NCP stance from their pre-election platform. \n \"It's hard to figure out how much of the work will be left to volunteer organizations, and how much they will be effectively pushing things forward themselves,\" she says. \n Climate expert  Hanna Aho  from the development NGO umbrella group Fingo says that she too has sensed a conflict within the NCP. She says that the party has presented several concrete initiatives to combat climate change, and several MPs have made important contributions, but that she found many of their campaign slogans to be in some part antagonistic to the cause. \n Aho also says it is also valuable to examine party messages for their consistency. For example, a political party might have outlined ambitious climate goals, but at the same time be in support of subsidies that are harmful to the environment. \n Next government will have a major climate impact \n After the  14 April elections , the future government will define climate policy for the next four years. The experts in the STT poll predict several divisive issues may come up in negotiations to form the new coalition. For example, there are clear dividing lines between the parties on the issue of using peat for energy, the area of business subsidies, and the extent to which a climate action plan should be built on the back of Finland's electricity supply. \n Heiskanen estimates that potential coalition partners will have an easier time agreeing on such things as support for the circular economy and funding for research and development. \n WWF's Rahunen says it is unclear how big a priority climate issues will be in the government formation talks, as none of the nine parliamentary parties have indicated whether certain climate measures would be potential red lines in the sand when it comes to cooperation. \n Fingo's Aho comments that the ideal situation would be a future government made up of parties with mutually reinforcing environmental aims. \n \"But if, for example, the SDP and the NCP end up in the same coalition, with no Green or Left Alliance input, then it's really hard for me to see that at the end of the day, sufficient climate action would be taken,\" she says. \n Heiskanen says she was also surprised by how little mention the parties made of legislation in the climate sections of their pre-election manifestos. \n \"Only the Swedish People's Party had nicely declared that climate considerations should be taken into account in the drafting of all future laws.\""}

{"text": "Last summer, Finns Party lawmaker  Teuvo Hakkarainen  was  convicted of assault and sexual harassment  against fellow MP  Veera Ruoho  after a Christmas party in December 2017. \n The Helsinki Court of Appeal has now raised Hakkarainen's punishment from 45 day fines to 80 day fines. Based on Hakkarainen's income, that adds up to 5,440 euros. \n Ruoho, who earlier in 2017 defected from the nationalist Finns Party to the conservative National Coalition Party, was sitting in the Parliament House café with another MP when she was approached by Hakkarainen, who had been drinking at a party elsewhere in the building. \n Ruoho told the court that Hakkarainen grabbed her jaw and tried forcibly to kiss her despite her protestations. \n The appellate court ruled on Friday that a previous district court sentence was insufficient. It ordered Hakkarainen's fine to be raised because the violence was directed toward the head and neck area, involved sexual harassment and took place at their workplace. \n Prosecutor sought suspended jail term \n Prosecutor  Eija Velitski  had called for a two-month suspended prison sentence for Hakkarainen. However the court ruled that the act did not warrant imprisonment, as it did not involved choking. \n It did however find that Hakkarainen had firmly grabbed Ruoho in a headlock and turned her head. \n \"Despite the potential danger, [the incident] was very brief and the harm relatively mild,\" the court declared. \n The prosecutor argued that the assault led to Ruoho having to undergo neck surgery last June, as well as \"long-running aches and pains in the neck area as well as insomnia due to shock\". \n \"If the right spot is pressed there, it can kill you,\" Velitski told the news agency STT, claiming that the incident had re-activated an old sports injury. \n Ruoho is a former member of the Finnish Olympic taekwondo team and police officer specialising in foreign citizens' issues. She quit the Finns Party in mid-2017 when immigration hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho  became its leader. \n Hakkarainen has a record of seven convictions since 1985, including chopping down trees illegally while drunk, stealing silverware and wine from a church, drunk driving, speeding, and  incitement against an ethnic group  for anti-Muslim comments on Facebook in 2016. \n Either side may still appeal the case to the Supreme Court."}

{"text": "Nine politicians locked horns in the Yle News election debate on Monday, with topics from climate change, through ethics in politics to labour market policies under the microscope ahead of elections due on 14 April. \n Our pundits highlights some surprising stances, fixed ideological positions, a likely end to austerity and, amid a nine-way discussion, Finland's 'crowded political marketplace'. \n Sini Korpinen , politics expert for the All Points North podcast, said that she found the ethical dimension raised in the show brought up interesting contrasts when  Veronika Honkasalo , a leftist councillor from Helsinki said she had a clear line on coalition partners. Korpinen doesn’t think everything is so simple. \n \"Where do you draw the line? We have seen them walking out of government for some other issues. They are so strict about their principles that I’m not sure they are a good coalition partner. It’s not an easy question when you get into the broader issues.\" \n Finns Party MP  Laura Huhtasaari’s  reaction was also a point of interest for Korpinen, who said Huhtasaari’s party has shifted slightly as the election approaches. \n \"[Finns Party leader]  Jussi Halla-aho  has previously said that the party does not care whether other parties want to be in government with them, but now they have said they want to be in government and they have to react--it is an interesting dynamic,\" said Korpinen. \n Story continues after photo \n \n Fellow APN pundit  Sam Kingsley  said that participants' language skills were up to the task. \n \"The level of English among all the candidates was extremely impressive, especially when you consider they have to sell their ideas at the same time, even knowing how well Finns speak English,\" said Kingsley. \n The tricky task of playing a political insurgent when you're actually in the government was given to Environment Minister Kimmo Tiilikainen, and Kingsley felt his role revealed something about this election. \n Story continues after photo \n \n \"He came out fighting against austerity cuts and this government’s record, which showed almost an accepted truth in this election which is that austerity has gone too far,\" said Kingsley. \"He was saying that his government has brought the nation’s finances back into balance, trying to claim that any largesse possible now is thanks to the government’s fiscal record.\" \n Voters face a difficult decision \n Aki Ruotsala  was a 'good speaker', according to Kingsley, who noted that the general competence displayed in the debate showed how difficult the decision will be for many voters. \n \"The debate showed how crowded the Finnish political marketplace is in many ways,\" noted Kingsley. \"Voters have a tough job choosing who they want to vote for, and it will come down to charisma and personality in the end--which we’ve seen in previous elections as well.\" \n Our pundits were intrigued by the focus of the Finns Party representative on one policy area. \n Story continues after photo \n Yle News / Mark B. Odom \n “It was clear that the only policy area Huhtasaari was comfortable on was immigration, she didn’t have much else to offer,” said Korpinen. \n \"It was interesting that Huhtasaari kept talking about asylum seekers and crime when the debate had moved on to talk about employment and integration, and that showed how the Finns Party are really focusing on their core message that immigrants make us unsafe, even though figures perhaps don’t bear that out,\" said Kingsley. \"It showed how ideological immigration is as an issue for the Finns Party. \n The \"humane\" side of immigration \n Immigration was a hot-button issue, and one dear to the hearts of the Yle News audience. Korpinen noticed one contribution that was perhaps a little surprising. \n \"Elina Lepomäki  was very good, talking about the humane aspect of immigration policy--it was unusual to hear a National Coalition Party politician talk like that because usually their party line is about immigrants paying taxes to compensate for Finland’s low birth rate,\" said Korpinen. \n Korpinen picked out Social Democrat  Antton Rönnholm  and  Elina Lepomäki  as the debate’s star performers, but gave a special mention to the Blue Reform representative. \n \"Lepomäki managed to soften the image of the National Coalition, and Rönnholm was very good at talking about values-based politics,\" said Korpinen. \" Tiina Ahva  was very clear and got her points across very well, she didn’t dodge any questions she just answered in a fairly straightforward way.\" \n \"Whatever you think of the party’s policies she was very well-researched, she had clear lines of thought and she came across well,\" agreed Kingsley. \"We can be absolutely sure that we’ll be seeing more of her in years to come, whatever you think of her policies or politics.\" \n Korpinen also felt the discussion was well-managed, declaring on Twitter that she was starting the ' Denise Wall  Appreciation Group'. \n \"I was impressed by the moderators, they were good at holding candidates to account and especially good at keeping watch of the clock!\""}
{"text": "The elimination of biannual clock-changing rituals across the EU has taken a step forward. \n On Tuesday the European Parliament voted to eliminate the practice of changing the clocks by an hour back and forth twice a year across the EU. MEPs approved the measure by a margin of 410 yes votes, 192 no votes and 51 abstentions. All 28 EU states currently change their clocks an hour ahead and back twice a year. \n The EU Parliament endorsed a proposal by the European Commission to end the biannual clock change, but pushed forward the deadline from this year to 2021. \n The matter is not settled however, as each EU country needs to decide whether to remain on daylight saving time (during spring and summer) and standard time (from mid-autumn until early spring). \n Consensus needed \n Last month the Finnish government said it  supports scrapping seasonal daylight saving  and to permanently stay on standard time. A  citizens' initiative  on the matter was sent to Finnish lawmakers in 2017. \n In order to avoid problems and market conflicts, the EU Parliament said it wants individual countries to coordinate their decisions on their changes with each other. \n Going forward - if and when member states come to agreement - countries that decide to stay on daylight saving time will turn their clocks forward an hour for the final time in March 2021 and those that choose to remain on standard time will turn their clocks back an hour for the last time in October 2021. \n Last year, following requests from the public, the EU Parliament and some member states, the EU Commission decided to examine the issue of eliminating the practice of daylight saving time changes."}
{"text": "A survey conducted by leading circulation daily Helsingin Sanomat suggests that  Greens chair  Pekka Haavisto  has emerged as the lead candidate to be Finland’s next prime minister after parliamentary elections due in April. \n Haavisto managed to force a second round in Finland's 2012 presidential election, but lost to the National Coalition Party candidate  Sauli Niinistö . Niinistö later  crushed a second challenge from Haavisto  and others in the 2018 presidential poll. \n Altogether 22 percent of survey respondents said they’d like to see Haavisto take office after next month’s parliamentary elections. The second-most popular candidate for the post was the National Coalition Party’s  Petteri Orpo , with 16 percent backing from interviewees. \n Next in line in third and fourth position with 15 and 14 percent backing respectively were the Social Democratic Party’s  Antti Rinne  and the Centre Party’s  Juha Sipilä . \n In spite of voters’ preferences for the next prime minister, party support polls show that  the next premier is likely to come from the Social Democratic Party or the National Coalition Party . \n Market research firm Kantar TNS interviewed 1,000 respondents for the HS poll in March and the margin of error was +/- three percentage points. \n Meanwhile, in a separate poll by the Lännen Media newspaper consortium, respondents also placed Haavisto ahead of other contenders in the race for the premiership. That survey, which was conducted by pollster Taloustutkimus for the newspaper group, also put the NCP’s Orpo in second place. \n Voters want the SDP and Greens in government \n Respondents to yet another survey indicated that the opposition parties the SDP and the Greens are favourites to form the backbone of the next government. \n This time around, the agricultural lobby-backed paper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus commissioned Kantar TNS to sound public opinion on the three parties voters would like to see in government. The pollster questioned just over 1,000 voters on their opinions in mid-March. \n Respondents placed the NCP in third place, narrowly ahead of Juha Sipilä’s Centre. Drilling down into the poll data indicated that while the Centre still has strong support in rural areas, it has lost its top ranking among these voters to the SDP. \n The Foundation for Municipal Development KAKS also tested voters’ temperature on the issue of which parties they’d like to see in government. \n According to that survey, nearly half of respondents said they’d like to see the SDP in government, followed by the Greens with 35 percent backing. Both the NCP and the Centre trailed with just over 30 percent support for forming the next administration."}
{"text": "Voters are rallying behind  the immigration-sceptic Finns Party  according to Yle’s latest political barometer, which shows the group with 15.1 percent approval. The party posted a 1.8-percentage-point gain in the poll to outstrip Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party and grab third place as the country’s most popular political force. \n According to research director  Tuomas Turja  of pollster Taloustutkimus, the growth in backing for the Finns Party was especially due to so-called \"sleeping voters\" gravitating toward the nationalistic group. \n \"The Finns Party are now getting more supporters from those who didn’t know or didn’t want to say which party they voted for in the 2015 election,\" Turja added. \n In spite of the Finns Party’s pre-election surge, the largest opposition group, the Social Democratic Party, remains at the top of the voter approval poll with 20.1 percent support, despite losing 1.2 percentage points of voter backing. \n Meanwhile the National Coalition Party led by Finance Minister  Petteri Orpo  retained its second-place ranking with 15.8 percent approval, down marginally by 0.4 percentage points from a previous poll released on 7 March. At the same time, the NCP has narrowed the gap with the SDP. \n According to Turja any confusion caused by  the SDP’s stance on meat consumption  was not reflected in the outcome of Friday’s survey. \"The last week of measurement was the best for the SDP,\" the researcher noted. \n Small boost for Centre after govt resignation \n Juha Sipilä’s Centre Party saw a marginal bump in its approval rating, which edged up by 0.3 percentage points to 14.4 percent but was pushed into fourth place by the rise of the Finns Party. \n Just one day after the last Yle poll, Sipilä marched to President  Sauli Niinistö ’s residence at Mäntyniemi to  announce his government’s resignation  over its failed social and health care reform programme. Reports indicated that the PM’s decision to quit government had affected the party’s election campaign. However the pollster did not see much evidence of this in the survey. \n \"The weekly results show that the support for the Centre rose in the week after the government’s resignation. However after that it has remained unchanged. There was no evidence of a major spike,\" Turja commented. \n Now in fifth place in the party ranking, the Greens have the support of 13 percent of voters, down 0.7 percentage points from the previous poll three weeks ago. Immediately trailing in sixth place, the Left Alliance saw a slight rise of 0.9 percentage points to settle at 9.8 percent voter backing. Taloustutkimus speculated that poll respondents may have switched allegiance from the Greens and the SDP to the Left. \n According to Turja, all of the changes in Friday’s poll fall well within the survey’s margin of error of +/-2.3 percentage points. He noted that the margin of error is somewhat larger than usual because the sample size was smaller and the survey period was shorter than before. \n Finnish politics converging with Europe \n Researcher  Johanna Vuorelma  of Tampere University noted that the margins separating parties in the Yle polls have narrowed. \n \"The fact that we see four parties separated by less than three percentage points is a very different situation than two years ago, for example,\" she pointed out, referring to municipal elections that took place in 2017. \n \"We can see a very European development there. The landscape is fragmenting and no one party alone has the top position,\" she added. \n She remarked that voter activity is likely to influence a party’s popularity. For example, Finns Party backers may include people who are highly likely not to vote. \n \"In many ways, support for the Finns Party is difficult to forecast. But it could be that the party could once more surprise us during the election,\" Vuorelma said, adding that minimal polling differences among parties also makes government negotiations trickier. \n 47 seats for the SDP \n Since the beginning of the year, Taloustutkimus has calculated the number of MPs parties would seat based on successive polls, compared to their current representation in parliament. \n The calculations have been based on poll results gathered over the past six months, which means that the projected number of seats may differ from individual survey outcomes. \n Based on current calculations the SDP, which has been leading in the polls, would win 13 additional seats, easily making it the largest political party with 47 MPs. \n The pollster Taloustutkimus interviewed just under 2,000 respondents for the survey between 6 and 26 March."}
{"text": "A fresh Yle poll shows Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party hobbling toward next month's general election  with 14.4 percent voter support . Political commentator  Sini Korpinen  and journalist  Sam Kingsley  told APN that the party may be heading for one of its poorest election outcomes, if Friday's poll is anything to go by. \n According to the pundits, Juha Sipilä has gone from being a promising \"breath of fresh air\" as a political neophyte who took over the party in 2015, to being the face of an government that introduced deep austerity cuts. If Sipilä is to be believed, he will  step down as party chair  if the Centre doesn't do well in the election on 14 April. \n Centre in opposition? \n Korpinen said that while the Centre has proved willing to experiment with new leadership in the past -- for example electing urbanite  Mari Kiviniemi  as chair in 2010 -- it will have to contend with traditionalists among its ranks. She added that the Centre's current polling may also suggest that it will likely sit out the next term in opposition, more so since it has typically not fared well in the polls after being in an administration that includes  Petteri Orpo 's National Coalition Party. \n APN's panelists also dissected Environment Minister  Kimmo Tiilikainen 's boast on  Yle News' election debate earlier this week  that the government was able to meet and exceed its employment target of 72 percent, paving the way for the next administration to build on its accomplishments. \n Korpinen said that the next government will likely have to make equally painful decisions to implement more spending cuts and to take forward much-needed social and health care reform. Kingsley, meanwhile, pointed out that the quality of the jobs responsible for the growth in employment was questionable, as many were not stable full-time positions. \n Party views in Yle News' election debate \n If you missed the live broadcast of the Yle News election debate, you can still catch the programme  on our website , on  Yle Areena  and  our Facebook page . \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

{"text": "From 1 April, Finnish citizens living abroad will no longer be eligible for the full range of benefits provided by benefits agency Kela. \n Daily Helsingin Sanomat writes  that the period of benefit eligibility used to be one year for citizens of Finland moving to live in another country; now the social security institution Kela will revoke a recipient's benefits after just six months of living abroad. Even a brief stint of work in another EU country may also lead to benefit revocation, although the right is reinstated once the worker returns to live indefinitely in Finland. \n HS reports that tens of thousands of Finnish citizens will be affected by the change as they travel across the border, some numerous times a year. \n \"It's a real puzzle especially when migrating outward from Finland,\" said Kela lawyer  Antti Klemola . \"Kela will no longer decide on the right to social benefits as a separate ruling; instead the right will now be decided case by case when applying for assistance.\" \n On the other hand, employees or researchers sent away on a work assignment may still receive Kela benefits for as long as five years during their stay. Students leaving to study as well as their family members will still be entitled to Kela benefits. \n Klemola said in HS that the six-month benefit residence period includes some wiggle room created by EU legislation. Negotiations are usually conducted with the authorities of the country in question. \n \"For Finnish pensioners who winter in Spain, for instance, Kela will use EU law to determine whether Finland or Spain is the customer's country of residence. That is, where they have the strongest ties.\" \n Kela pays out pensions within the European Union regardless of the recipient's country of residence. \n Consulates cut back, sell silverware (?) \n Britain's fraught exit from the EU is causing ripples across the world already, including at Britain's diplomatic operations in Finland,  regional paper Turun Sanomat  wrote in an April Fool's Day joke article. \n According to the paper, consular services offices in the small towns of Raahe, Kokkola and Kristiinankaupunki are being shut down outright, while the Turku office will keep serving expatriate Brits but with less resources than before. The consulate's silverware, vases, furniture, candelabras and other precious items will be auctioned off on Monday. \n \"We find this very unfortunate, but we have to work with what we've got,\" TS quotes Foreign Affairs publicist  Christine Keeler  as saying. \"UK funds are being directed toward developing ties with non-EU countries ahead of Brexit.\" \n The public is invited to view the items on sale at Turku's volunteer fire department building or \"WPK house\" on 1 April, where the auction will commence at 12 noon, the paper reports. \n Online error boosts right-wing election vid \n Meanwhile national broadcaster Yle publicly apologised to Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  for accidentally removing his pre-election interview clip from the online Areena service over the weekend. \n Aamulehti reports  that an update to Yle's publication platform caused Halla-aho's video and several dozen other programmes to be temporarily unavailable on the website. \n The problem was fixed by Sunday evening, with Yle head of communications  Jere Nurminen  saying in AL that the view counter for Halla-aho's video did not reset. The party chair's interview jumped right to the top of the list of most viewed election content at over 100,000 views after he tweeted about the glitch, beating out Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's election interview by some 10,000 views. \n Yle CEO  Merja Ylä-Anttila  offered her apologies for the error via Twitter. \n Edit: Clarified Kela benefits story. \n Edit: Yle News was clearly fooled by Turun Sanomat's article on UK consulate office closings.

{"text": "Daily Helsingin Sanomat reports that  advance voting in the parliamentary elections begins on  Wednesday. In Finland, voters will be able to cast their ballot in advance until 9 April at any advance voting station in the country or abroad. Outside of Finland, however, the advance voting period is shorter, as it ends on 6 April. \n The paper offers some advice to prospective voters. Some form of photo ID such as a valid passport or driver's license is required at the polling station. Voters must go alone into the booth to mark their ballot. Children are allowed to accompany adults, but not dogs. \n Write only the candidate's number on the ballot, nothing else – or your vote may be rejected. HS also advises voters to write sevens with a line in the middle, as is the custom in parts of Europe and Latin America, to distinguish them from the number one. If you make a mistake, do not cross it out; ask for a new ballot instead. \n The official Election Day is on 14 April. On this day, voters must go to the appointed polling station stated on the ballot paper they should have received in the post. A justice ministry representative tells the paper that this is because election officials wish to count the number of votes cast at each station. Although in Finland the results are usually quite clear already by 10 pm on Election Day, official election results won't be confirmed until 17 April. \n The newly-elected Finnish Parliament will begin its work after the Easter holiday, on Tuesday, 23 April. \n Either NCP or Centre, with a side of Greens  \n Business weekly Talouselämä interviews Social Democratic Party (SDP) chair  Antti Rinne , whose party has been consistently out in front in  recent voter opinion polls . If his party wins the highest proportional number of seats on 14 April, Rinne will be in charge of putting together the next coalition government to rule the country for the next four years. \n Talouselämä asks him the question that is on many peoples' minds:  Who does he plan to ask to join the SDP in government, if the party emerges a clear winner at the polls ? \n \"I believe that if we are in government, then either the National Coalition Party (NCP) or the Centre Party would also be there. In addition, it looks quite clear that the Greens will be in the government. And then, if what I heard in Li's [Andersson] Yle interview is true, the Left Alliance's stance has changed a bit, and they would also join, if the NCP does not hold the prime minister position,\" Rinne told the paper. \n Rinne stresses that SDP success on 14 April is not a foregone conclusion, however. Talouselämä says he has reason to be cautious, as SDP voters are notoriously unreliable about showing up to vote. The publication points out that the Social Democrats also led public opinion polls in the 2017 municipal elections, but when the results were tallied, the NCP came out on top. \n Talouselämä says that even if Rinne were to win a mandate from the people, government formation is no easy task in Finland, nor is working with it once it has been created. It writes that every government in the last 16 years has suffered from \"in-fighting or prime minister problems\". The last government to serve out an entire term was Paavo Lipponen's coalition in 1999-2003, although the Greens walked out of that coalition before the term was out. \n Only one in three firms have ethical guidelines \n And the southwest newspaper Turun Sanomat writes about  inadequate ethical guidelines in Finnish companies . \n A Nordic Business Ethics Survey from early 2019 comparing Finland, Sweden and Norway has determined that only 35 percent of Finnish companies have ethical guidelines in place, compared to 69 percent of Norwegian companies and 64 percent of Swedish companies. \n The group behind the survey was shocked to see how many workers in Finland had no idea if their company even had a code of conduct. If they knew of one, they did not know its content, TS writes. The survey also discovered a paucity of training in this area, with only one-third of respondents saying they had participated in a company function in which these matters were outlined. \n The survey also found that 28 percent of respondents in Finland did not know the procedure for reporting unethical practices in line with organisational guidelines. The paper suggests that this is a worrying phenomenon in light of recent  impropriety in the financial sector , for example."}
{"text": "With less than two weeks away to parliamentary elections on 14 April, nine of Finland's minor parties made their stances known in a debate hosted by public broadcaster Yle on Tuesday evening. \n According to opinion polls, none of the parties appear to have any chance of getting into government. Yle's most recent political party poll found there was about 3.1 percent voter support for all of the minor parties combined. \n That same  poll  found that the combined voter support for the top three major parties last month - including the Social Democrats, National Coalition Party and the Finns Party - was 51 percent. \n Given their positions, if the minor parties somehow did ascend to government the country's policies and laws would look quite different than they are today. \n The parties that participated* in Tuesday's debate included: \n Feminist Party Citizens' Party Finnish People First Pirate Party Animal Justice Party of Finland Liberal Party Communist Party of Finland Communist Workers' Party Independence Party \n Climate change \n Global climate change is one of the top concerns among voters, according to several recent political surveys. In response to a straw poll question on whether climate change is a looming threat, seven party representatives answered yes, while two others said no. \n Chair of the anti- immigration party Finnish People First,  Marco de Wit , characterised the concept of global climate change as \"propaganda.\" The EU-sceptic Citizens' Party's  Sami Kilpeläinen  agreed. \n \"Each and every one of us can certainly do something to slow down climate change, but the threat [of climate change] is exaggerated,\" Kilpeläinen said. \n The chair of the Feminist Party,  Katju Aro , disagreed. \n \"We must stop global warming temperature [levels] at 1.5 degrees (Celsius) and cut our carbon output by 2030 at the latest - that's completely clear. We still have a lot to do,\" Aro said. \n Tea Törmänen , chair of the Liberal Party, said that Finland should take advantage of climate change as a business opportunity, saying the country could sell its technical expertise in areas like nuclear energy abroad. \n Meanwhile, the Pirate Party's  Petrus Pennanen  said that half of the carbon emissions in Helsinki were due to the use of fossil fuels for its district heating system and said it could be powered by small-scale nuclear power plants. \n Fundamental outliers \n In the unlikely scenario that the Communist Workers' Party was voted into government, the party's chair,  Mikko Vartiainen , said it would likely be difficult to find other parties with similar values with which to cooperate. \n \"No parliamentary group has the same goal as us, that is, to overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism,\" Vartiainen said. \n The ideological differences between the various parties were sometimes major, particularly when it came to the topic of national defence. \n Regarding international military assistance from outside the country, the Citizens' Party's Kilpeläinen said that he would not support having foreign soldiers on Finnish territory \"under any circumstances.\" \n He said that the party would like to stop Finland's international defence cooperation with Nato as well as Sweden. \n Both representatives from the Independence Party and Finnish People First said that they would like to put a stop to international military cooperation. \n A straw poll on whether or not the representatives would consider Finland as part of the West in the face of a world conflict resulted in six parties answering yes. The Independence Party, the Citizens' Party and the Finnish People First party all said no. \n Health care reform \n Last month Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's centre-right government collapsed in the final weeks of its four-year term after long-planned reforms of the country's health and social care system (colloquially known as  sote )  failed . \n The Pirate Party's Pennanensaid he wasn't a believer in the reform's aim to significantly re-consolidate the country's health care system by region. \n \"We already have five districts for specialised health care services in Finland - it's a good foundation on which to build. The municipality-based system can be developed further, but the state must be prepared to assist municipalities that can't manage on their own,\" Pennanen said \n Conscription and hate speech \n The topic of Finland's conscription system was raised by both the Feminist and Liberal parties, but in terms of equality. Currently only young men are required to serve in the military, but women are able to do so voluntarily. \n \"We absolutely support gender-neutral conscription, our present system is really unfair,\" the Liberal Party's Törmänen said. \n The Feminist Party's Aro said she has has been the target of hate speech and the recipient of hate mail. \n \"I have received a good deal of various [kinds of] hate mail. Our voters and supporters have too, some of whom are immigrants. I don't agree with the notion that forbidding hate speech is a form of limiting free speech,\" Aro said. \n However Kilpeläinen of the Citizens' Party said that the police have better things to do than enforcing hate speech laws. \n \"Hate speech is a fictitious concept. The powers of police are being used to control others. We already have defamation laws. Why are we even talking about hate speech?\" Kilpeläinen said. \n Neither of the communist parties could come to agreement on the topic of hate speech. \n Mikko Vartiainen , chair of the Communist Workers' Party, said that there are already laws on the books prohibiting incitement to hate and violence. \n But chair of the Communist Party of Finland,  Juha-Pekka Väisänen , said thathe would be prepared to ban hate speech. \n _  The relatively newly-minted Seven Star Movement was also invited to the debate but the  party's  founder and chair  *Paavo Väyrynen  declined._"}
{"text": "Finland's centre-right National Coalition Party will likely be asked to join in a coalition with the Social Democratic Party, if both parties win enough votes, according to political commentator  Sini Korpinen  and journalist  Sam Kingsley  who joined APN to talk about the NCP's prospects in the election and its potential role in a future government. \n NCP party chair  Petteri Orpo  recently beat the SDP chair in a public opinion poll as a more popular prime minister choice than SDP chair  Antti Rinne , proving he has greater appeal among the electorate. \n Yle's  latest voter survey  shows the NCP trailing the poll-topper Social Democrats, with 15.8 percent and 20.1 percent voter support respectively. SDP leaders have  made noises  about possibly asking the NCP to join them in the governing coalition, if the labour-friendly group comes out on top after 14 April. \n In the event that the third-place Finns Party wins big at the ballot box, Kingsley said he could also see the NCP being one of the few political parties willing to work with the nationalists, because both parties just came out of a four years of cooperation. \n Korpinen said she believes that the NCP has clearly taken a more conservative turn in response to the rising popularity of the Finns Party. Both she and Kingsley surmised that, for example, countryside billboards defending the use of private cars may end up being a misstep with eco-conscious urban voters, however. \n Korpinen also suggested that the NCP's role in the social and health care reform could also be construed as an attack on the welfare state, and this too may cost it votes on the upcoming parliamentary elections. \n Check out the Yle News election debate for more \n If you missed the live broadcast of the Yle News election debate, you can still catch the programme  on our website , on  Yle Areena  and  our Facebook page . \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

{"text": "Election officials began a vote recount in the electoral district of Satakunta in western Finland on Monday, following  Sunday's general election . The review, which was due to take place at a local police station, means that an official result for the parliamentary seat may not be available until Tuesday. The results of Sunday's election is scheduled to be confirmed by the Justice Ministry on Wednesday. \n Antti Rinne ’s SDP won three seats in the Satakunta district by razor thin margins. If just additional 100 votes are awarded to  Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party in the recount, it could win an additional in the district and the SDP’s elected MPs in the region would fall to two. \n Losing one seat would mean that the Finns Party and the SDP would draw level with 39 seats each overall, although the centre-left party garnered a slightly larger share of the vote than the populists. The Centre meanwhile, would see its parliamentary seat count rise to 32. That outcome could upend the calculus  with regard to government formation talks . \n Lapland district also closely contested \n Chair of the electoral district,  Vappu Laukkanen  said that it is very rare for recounts to yield any major surprises. She noted that they generally involve a few votes that have either been miscounted due to negligence, or assigned to the wrong candidate. \n Justice Ministry election director,  Arto Jääskeläinen , said that it is extremely uncommon for seats to be re-assigned from one party to another following a recount. However he noted that it is more likely for the votes counted in favour of different candidates from the same party to change. \n In addition to Satakunta, the situation in the Lapland electoral district is also close. In that case the Greens would need fewer than ten additional votes to sweep one seat from the Centre Party. Based on Sunday night’s results, the Centre Party won three seats in Lapland, followed by the Finns Party, the National Coalition Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Left Alliance, all with one seat each. \n Sunday's election saw government parties with the exception of the National Coalition Party  suffer heavy losses , while opposition parties gained additional seats or hold their ground in the parliament.."}

{"text": "The nationalist Finns Party has accelerated past the centre-right National Coalition Party to claim second place in a pre-election poll released by Yle on Thursday. \n With parliamentary elections due on Sunday, the Finns Party now have 16.3 percent voter support, up from 15.1 percent in  a previous poll in late March . Thursday’s result represents a 1.2-percentage-point increase from last month and a six-percentage point rise from last autumn. \n Yle election analyst, parliamentary researcher  Sami Borg  from Tampere University, attributed the Finns Party’s voter approval boost  to national discourse about sexual offences and immigration  that ignited toward the end of last year. \n \"With respect to the climate change debate, the Finns Party has also successfully offered a clear alternative and a different perspective compared to other parties. And [party leader  Jussi ]  Halla-aho  has also clearly run a successful campaign\", Borg explained. \n Research director  Tuomo Turja  of pollster Taloustutkimus said that the Finns Party  has been able to attract  many new supporters from the ranks of people who abstained from voting in the last general election. He said the party was also able entice voters who would have typically voted for the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party, and to some extent the poll-topping Social Democratic Party. \n While the SDP led by  Antti Rinne  has held on to the lead in the Yle poll for the entire year, it saw voter approval slip below the 20-percent mark to 19 percent, down 1.1-percentage-point from the late March survey. \n \"It is often the case that the poll-leader’s margin narrows in the last survey,\" Turja noted, adding that the same happened to the Centre Party just before the last parliamentary election in 2015. \n The pollster noted that all of the changes in party popularity were well within the poll’s 2.3-percentage-point margin of error. \n The Finns Party’s pre-election surge has pushed the National Coalition Party into third place in voter approval, with 15.9 percent support. Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä’ s Centre Party remained in fourth place with 14.5 percent backing. \n Second place still wide open \n The survey indicates that the race to become the country’s most popular political party continues to intensify, given the drop in support for the SDP to under 20 percent, the first time in more than a year that it has slipped below this boundary. \n The pollster said that it would be unusual for no party to corner more than 20 percent of ballots in the election. The closest similar situation occurred during the 2011 general election, when the NCP scraped together 20.4 percent of voter ballots. \n According to Borg, there doesn’t seem to be any ambiguity about the parties’ final order at the finish line, but the SDP will emerge as the winner of the election based on different metrics. \n \"From the SDP’s perspective, what is essential is the lead over the other parties. The difference appears to be on the order of two to three percentage points, so the party appears to have a rather secure lead compared to previous elections since 2000,\" he added. \n However Turja from Taloustutkimus appeared reluctant to declare any election winners just yet. \n \"Research shows that increasing numbers of voters take their decision about whom to vote for right down to the wire, even on voting day,\" he noted. \n \"Regardless of who wins the election, it will be difficult to form a government with these numbers. At least second place is wide open, with two or three parties competing for it.\" \n Finns Party and Greens voters most undecided \n In addition to the SDP, voters also cooled on the Left Alliance and the Greens in the latest survey. The Greens saw voter approval edge down 0.8-percentage-point to 12.2 percent. However, compared to the 2015 election, the current level of support is likely to give the party its best election outcome. Meanwhile, support for the Left Alliance slid 1.1 percentage point to 8.7 percent in Yle’s fresh barometer. \n Turja pointed out that for the Finns Party and the Greens in particular the election result will depend on how well they are able to activate their supporters. \n Thursday’s poll also asked voters how certain they were about their choice of party. The survey included people who had already cast their ballots during advance voting, as well as others who said they planned to exercise their franchise. Respondents were interviewed during advance voting. \n \"The Finns Party’s challenge is most certainly that of all the largest parties, they absolutely have the highest number of undecided voters. Their voting certainty is weaker than that of the other parties,\" Turja expanded. \n On the other hand, the poll indicated that  Petteri Orpo ’s NCP had the most unwavering voters. \n Among the smaller parties, the Swedish People’s Party saw a 0.6-percentage-point bump that took its backing to 4.9 percent, while the Christian Democrats experienced a similar blip to reach 4.3 percent. \n Among the major parliamentary groups, the Blue Reform trailed the field with 0.8 percent voter backing, down 0.1 percentage point from the last survey. Turja described the party’s election prospects as “very bad”. \n \"The Blues' only chance is for one of their best-known candidates to be elected in the Uusimaa electoral district,\" he concluded."}

{"text": "Yle's last  pre-election poll released on Thursday  shows the Social Democratic Party (SDP) leading the field but with somewhat less support from voters. The SDP now has 19 percent voter backing and the Finns Party have leap-frogged over the National Coalition Party to take second place with 16.3 percent approval. \n APN's resident pundits  Sini Korpinen  and  Sam Kingsley  were on hand to comment on the rather surprising development and speculate on which parties might be a part of Finland's next governing coalition. Both agreed that the SDP is likely to come out the leader in 14 April voting, despite an election platform that didn't seem to differ from many of the others on offer. \n Korpinen said she doubts that SDP party chair  Antti Rinne  would be able to partner with the nationalistic climate-change-denier Finns Party, wagering that the NCP and Greens might be the preferred partners. Kingsley disagreed, saying he foresaw a SDP-Centre-Green coalition on the horizon. \n No matter who wins the election, Korpinen noted that the next government will have a difficult go of it, as the economy is predicted to slow down and there are  still tough decisions on several reforms  that have to be made. \n Still undecided?

{"text": "Government parties took a drubbing in Finland’s parliamentary election on Sunday as Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party polled its lowest general election result ever with just 13.8 percent of the vote to lose 13 seats with all votes counted, while hard-right populist Finns Party came second with 39 seats, just one behind the Social Democrats' 40. \n Election result 2019 With 100% of vote counted: SDP 40 seats FP 39 NCP 38 CEN 31 GREENS 20 LEFT 16 SPP 9 CD 5 BLUE 0 OTHERS 2 \n Coalition partner Blue Reform was obliterated, getting just one percent of the vote and no MPs, while the third government partner the National Coalition Party emerged from four years in power relatively unscathed to gain one seat and finish on 38 seats. \n Sipilä, a former businessman, had promised to bring the efficiency of the private sector to government as prime minister. However his administration’s austerity policies and labour market experiments such as a contentious so-called activation model ruffled many feathers. Reacting to the results on Sunday, Sipilä said that the party was the evening’s biggest loser. \"We are the biggest loser and that must be acknowledged. The people have spoken,\" he added. \n An upstart in the race according to media polls, the Finns Party made good on pre-election polling and staged a strong finish with 17.5 percent of the vote. Immigration hardliner and party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  had previously had said he wanted to take the party into the next government. \n \"We have made it very clear to everybody that we are open to cooperation with everyone but not at any cost,\" Halla-aho said. \"We could not join a government which is not committed to reducing harmful immigration to Finland,\" he added. \n Halla-aho a big vote puller \n Halla-aho scored a double win for the Finns Party, as he emerged as the evening’s biggest vote magnet, attracting support from more than 30,000 voters. \n The centre-left Social Democratic Party managed a razor thin lead over its rivals, snapping up 17.7 percent of ballots cast, one of its poorest election outcomes ever. But that was enough for the Social Democrats to increase their parliamentary presence by six seats to 40, likely giving the party the mandate to initiate government formation talks. \n Party leader and former union boss  Antti Rinne  told Yle News that he is likely to focus on a few key issues in government. \"I hope we can solve this unemployment situation we have in Finland nowadays. It’s pensions, students, and child families are not doing so well in Finland now,\" he noted. \n The NCP ended the evening with 17 percent voter support, just trailing the populist Finns Party. The SDP and the NCP have not always seen eye-to-eye, but party chair  Petteri Orpo  did not rule out both parties cooperating in government. \n \"Of course it is possible if we find a common programme for the government. Our red lines are the economy. We want to keep public finances in balance and we want Finland to be an active member of the EU. And our main target is to get the unemployment rate to a Nordic level,\" Orpo told Yle News. \n The election was a hotly-contested race in which no single party was able to harvest 20 percent or more votes -- a situation that analysts described as unusual. The outcome reflects what pundits are calling an increasingly fragmented political landscape in Finland. \n \"People are looking for options. They have not been satisfied and that’s why we have seen the growth of support for the Finns Party and the Greens,\" said political commentator  Sini Korpinen , a frequent contributor to Yle News’ All Points North podcast. \n \"The age when three big parties take turns in government or in opposition are over. It’s time for politicians to figure out how to make things work,\" she added. \n 2019 records: Early voting, women make gains \n This year a record number of people -- more than 1.5 million or 36.1 percent of the electorate -- opted to cast their ballots early during advance voting. Early voting activity increased by about four percent compared to the previous general election. \n The overall voter turnout was 72 percent, up from 70 percent in the last general election in 2015. Korpinen told Yle that the outcome reflects the highly polarised nature of the election. \"It’s going to be very hard to negotiate a government, maybe the hardest ever. Anything can happen.\" \n The election has seated a record number of female MPs in the Finnish parliament. This year women will take up 92 positions as lawmakers, up from the previous record of 85 in 2011. In addition, this year saw more women than ever among the top vote-getters. \n One of Finland’s new vote magnets was NCP MP  Elina Lepomäki , whom punters see as a contender for party chair when party delegates meet to elect a new party leader in 2020. \n Overall, around 60 foreign-background candidates vied for seats in the election, according to Statistics Finland. \n Edit: Updated at 1.02am to reflect final result with all votes counted."}
{"text": "The independent daily  Helsingin Sanomat  notes how very tight  Sunday's parliamentary elections  were by pointing out that the winning margin enjoyed by the first-place Social Democratic Party was only some 6,800 votes ahead the second-ranked Finns Party. \n This win, writes HS, was in no way as big as what SDP Chair  Antti Rinne  had expected. The 17.7 percent of the vote polled is the second lowest in the parliamentary election history of the party. The only time it has fared worse was in the 2015 election. \n According to Helsingin Sanomat, it was \"clear as day\" that the SDP expected better results, and it predicts that Rinne will come in for criticism inside the party, and that his leadership will be challenged. Rinne himself said on Sunday that voters have \"misunderstood\" his party, but that is unlikely to work as an explanation. \n It was a matter of life and death for the SDP to come out on top in this election. Getting stuck behind the Finns Party would have been catastrophic for the SDP. The status as the nation's largest party was the minimum that the SDP was aiming for. \n Helsingin Sanomat says that upcoming government formation talks will be tough, but it is Rinne who will start leading those negotiations. \n No more big parties \n The Social Democratic Party newspaper  Demokraatti today writes  that it was a desire for change that won in these elections. This desire was channeled in two directions, with victories for the political left and for the Greens, but also for the populist Finns Party. \n Demokraatti goes on to say that if it is assumed in Finland that \"major parties\" poll at least 20 percent of the vote, then there are only mid-sized parties left in the country. Success in this election is being measured above all on two scales - a comparison with results in the previous election, and how results stack up against the other parties. In both respects, writes Demokraatti, the SDP was the most successful party. \n This paper says that the election results are so close and so exceptional that government formation talks will be complex. It points out that in a somewhat similar situation in the spring of 2011, negotiations on forming a new government took until Midsummer. Now, that is not really possible because of Finland's EU presidency, which begins on 1 July. \n Dark day for the Centre \n The Centre Party's  Suomenmaa  describes Sunday's loss as the gloomiest in the history of the traditionally rural-based party and predicts that it will generate a bitter internal debate on the reasons, and on the direction of the party must now take. \n Suomenmaa notes that since the Centre's main partner in the previous government, the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), did not suffer the same kind of defeat, there is plenty to ponder. \n \"Parliamentary elections have been held. The people have had their say, and their verdict on the Centre was especially harsh,\" writes Suomenmaa. \n It quotes former Centre Party leader and PM  Matti Vanhanen  as saying Sunday evening that one key reason may be that some of the most painful decisions taken by that government during the last election period did not affect NCP voters as much as they did Centre voters. \n Record number of women MPs \n The Greens-affiliated  Vihreä Lanka  points out that in addition to the very close finish at the top, another notable feature of Sunday's vote is the increase in the number of women elected to Parliament. \n As of early Monday morning, it looked as if Finland's new 200 member parliament will include 92 women MPs, a new record. \n Of the 20 Green candidates elected to parliament - or 21 if a recount in Lapland goes in favour of the Greens - only three are men. \n Vihreä Lanka also notes that all but six of the MPs in the Green's parliamentary group will be new faces. In addition, a new chair and new party secretary are to be elected at a party congress this coming summer. \n Whether this \"renewed\" Green League will be promoting its policies in the cabinet, or in opposition, is something that will be seen within the next few weeks, notes Vihreä Lanka. \n Familiar faces gone \n The Oulu-based  Kaleva  writes that many familiar faces will be missing from the ranks of MPs in the new parliament. \n The Blue Reform, which split from the Finns Party two years ago, failed to win a single seat in these elections. That means that four cabinet ministers in the last government,  Sampo Terho ,  Pirkko Mattila ,  Jari Lindström  and  Jussi Niinistö , will be looking for new jobs. Foreign Minister  Timo Soini , also of the Blue Reform, did not stand for reelection. \n Veteran politician  Paavo Väyrynen  failed to regain a seat as a candidate of his recently formed Seven Star Movement. A former Centre Party leader, government minister, MEP, and presidential candidate, Väyrynen has been a fixture on the political scene since first being elected to parliament in 1970. \n Nationalism here to stay \n Finnish politics are now in uncharted waters, according to the newsstand tabloid  Iltalehti . \n In an editorial column, the paper's editor-in-chief  Erja Yläjärvi  writes that politics have entered a completely new age in which not one of the winners can forecast what will happen next. One sure thing is that the time of the three big parties is over. \n In practice, the entire political opposition, the SDP, the Finns Party, the Greens and the Left Alliance, all marched to victory. \n On the implications of the strong showing by the populist Finns Party, Yläjärvi wrote, \"Finland is now clearly one of the numerous European countries where in election after election, anti-immigration sentiment and nationalism are permanently important values\". \n She adds that the pundits can forget the traditional coalitions of the past. Finland no longer lives in the old world where three big parties shared out power with junior partners. The situation is new, something that will make the weeks ahead as unpredictable as Sunday's elections were."}
{"text": "Following Sunday's hard-fought election, Finland's 200-seat legislature will feature 83 new MPs – some of whom aren't so new after all. \n Ari Koponen , who runs a charity service under the name \"Brother Christmas,\" was elected on the nationalist Finns Party from the Uusimaa electoral district, which includes Helsinki's surrounding municipalities. In early April, Koponen was charged with  violating fundraising laws . \n Among the MPs chosen in the Savo-Karelia electoral district is  Marko Kilpi  of the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), who is best known as the author of eight books, mostly crime fiction. He is also a Kuopio police officer who appeared in a popular police TV show and has made documentary films. \n As seen on TV \n Another well-known media figure,  Pirkka-Pekka Petelius , was elected on the Greens ticket in Uusimaa. He has appeared in Yle comedy and nature programmes as well as dozens films – including one based on a Marko Kilpi novel – and as a voice actor in the Finnish version of  The Lion King . \n Another new Greens MP is the party's deputy chair,  Maria Ohisalo , from Helsinki. She  served as the party's acting chair  after party leader Touko Aalto stepped due to health issues last autumn. \n She's joined by the youngest member of the new legislature, fellow Green  Iiris Suomela , 24, was ushered into parliament by voters in the Pirkanmaa district, which includes the city of Tampere.

The latter, a former reality TV show star, has made headlines due to a  hate speech conviction  and being  expelled by his church  due to his open bisexuality. \n Like father, like daughter \n Other MPs making comebacks include  former transport minister   Merja Kyllönen  of the Left Alliance, who was sent back to parliament by Oulu region voters after a stint in the European Parliament. \n Three former Social Democratic Party representatives return to the legislature after years off: Olympic silver medallist wrestler  Marko Asell  from Pirkanmaa, former justice minister  Johannes Koskinen  from the Häme district, and Uusimaa author and academic  Kimmo Kiljunen , recently in the headlines as mastermind of the  ill-fated Hamina Flag Park . \n A new generation is literally stepping into the legislature, as Centre Party veteran  Timo Kalli 's daughter  Eeva Kalli  was elected from south-west Finland while former SDP finance minister  Eero Heinäluoma 's daughter  Eveliina Heinäluoma  won a seat from Helsinki. Another former minister,  Ole Norrback  of the Swedish People's Party, saw his son  Anders Norrback  elected by Vaasa voters. All three carry on their fathers' party lines. \n Electoral districts are to certify their results by 6pm Tuesday. MPs are to present their credentials and form parliamentary groups on 23 April.

The results of Sunday's election is scheduled to be confirmed by the Justice Ministry on Wednesday. \n If just additional 100 votes were to be awarded to  Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party in the recount, it could have won an additional seat in the district and the SDP’s elected MPs in the region would have fallen to two. \n Losing one seat would have meant that the Finns Party and the SDP would have drawn level with 39 seats each overall, although the centre-left party garnered a slightly larger share of the vote than the populists. The Centre meanwhile, would have seen its parliamentary seat count rise to 32. That outcome could have upended the calculus  with regard to government formation talks . \n Lapland district also closely contested \n Chair of the electoral district,  Vappu Laukkanen  said that it is very rare for recounts to yield any major surprises. She noted that they generally involve a few votes that have either been miscounted due to negligence, or assigned to the wrong candidate. \n Justice Ministry election director,  Arto Jääskeläinen , said that it is extremely uncommon for seats to be re-assigned from one party to another following a recount. However he noted that it is more likely for the votes counted in favour of different candidates from the same party to change. \n In addition to Satakunta, the situation in the Lapland electoral district was also close. In that case the Greens needed fewer than ten additional votes to sweep one seat from the Centre Party. Based on Sunday night’s results, the Centre Party won three seats in Lapland, followed by the Finns Party, the National Coalition Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Left Alliance, all with one seat each. \n The election saw government parties with the exception of the National Coalition Party  suffer heavy losses , while opposition parties gained additional seats or hold their ground in the parliament.. \n Edit: Updated at 7.36pm to reflect that the recount confirmed the original result."}
{"text": "Aamulehti is among the papers that Tuesday carried a  syndicated Lännen Media analysis  of the prospects for upcoming government formation talks. \n According to this article, climate issues and taxation may be the main stumbling blocks in finding a smooth path for the creation of a working coalition. \n As the head of  the party that came in first place in Sunday's voting , SDP chairman  Antti Rinne  will be sending out a list of questions to other parties on policy issues on the 26th of this month. \n The paper says that it is clear that some of the questions will concern climate change. It will be difficult to find a fit between the ambitious climate programme promoted by the SDP and comments by Finns Party representatives about \"over-ambitious\" climate targets. This could well be one reason that the SDP will not invite the Finns Party into a coalition. \n As for taxation, the SDP and conservative NCP are far apart, Aamulehti notes. Demands by Rinne for a return to centralised labour agreements could also put the two parties on a collision course. \n The day after the election, the SDP leader stated that his immediate feeling was that the Left Alliance and the Greens would make for more natural allies in government. \n As the paper points out, these are also the three parties that made the biggest gains in Sunday's vote. \n The Centre Party has not declared itself out of the running for a place in a new cabinet. However, according to this paper, following its massive losses at the polls, the Centre has a lot of dirty laundry to wash before it will be fit to join in a coalition. The SDP and the Centre Party, though still have major differences, especially over Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä' s economic and employment policies. \n Regardless of what constellation of parties ends up in the cabinet, according to this analysis, in practice the Greens are all but certain to be a part of it. If so, it is likely that the Green chair,  Pekka Haavisto  will have the foreign affairs portfolio. \n EU election impact \n Turku's  Turun Sanomat  points out that the campaign for elections to the European Parliament will be underway at the same time as government formation talks are going on. It quotes Finns Party leader  Jussi Halla-aho  as saying that this could have an effect on the negotiations. \n Halla-aho pointed out that the various parties have to emphasise their differences in an election campaign, something that is not necessarily harmonious with the process of forming a new government. \n Political parties will be formally filing lists of candidates for the EU parliamentary elections on Thursday of this week. \n Channel surfing \n The Kuopio-based  Savon Sanomat  carries a Finnish News Agency STT report that over half the nation's population tuned into Yle television coverage of the elections on Sunday evening. \n Altogether 2.7 million viewers watched Yle's election reporting with a peak of almost 1.6 million between 9:30 PM and 9:44 PM. \n They were not all, however, glued to coverage, but bounced back and forth between TV1 and TV2 which was carrying the finals of the  Women's World Ice Hockey Championships , a broadcast that drew some 2.4 million pairs of eyes. \n Danger of measles growing \n Finland's largest circulation daily,  Helsingin Sanomat , Tuesday warned that the dangers posed by measles  could be growing in Finland again. \n The paper points to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) showing that the number of cases of measles has risen this year, especially in France, Poland, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Bulgaria and Ireland. \n According to Helsingin Sanomat, the spread of measles in Finland could rise as well, as the overwhelming majority of cases last year and this year were infections picked up in other parts of Europe. \n Last year there were 15 cases of measles identified in Finland. So far this year, there have been six. Last year three of those originated in Asia, the rest in Europe, both from EU countries and other nearby areas. \n The paper says that this may have influenced the rise registered in the number of inoculations against measles. According to figures released by Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare in February, 96.1 percent of children born in 2016 had received inoculations providing immunity against the measles. During the years 2014 and 2015, that figure was 94.9 percent. \n Notre Dame fire \n The blaze which heavily damaged Paris' Cathedral of Notre Dame Monday night was front-page news in almost every Finnish newspaper on Tuesday morning. \n As reported by most papers, including  Iltalehti , among the outpouring of sympathy from world leaders was a tweet by Finland's President  Sauli Niinistö  addressed to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. \n Screen capture of tweet by President Sauli Niinistö. Yle \n Writing in French, President Niinistö said, \"Finland shares the sadness in the face of this terrible fire at Notre Dame Cathedral. Our thoughts are with France and Parisians tonight.\""}
{"text": "National Coalition Party chair  Petteri Orpo  emerged from a party leadership meeting on Tuesday to carefully signal his party's readiness to join  government formation talks  following Sunday’s parliamentary election. \n Orpo said at a news conference Tuesday that there may be room to manoeuvre in some areas and noted that according to tradition, the position of Speaker of Parliament goes to the party that captured the second-highest proportion of votes, in this case, the Finns Party. \n The NCP  came away from the election with 38 parliamentary seats , just behind the populist Finns Party’s 39 and the Social Democratic Party’s 40 seats. \n NCP not the \"bad cop\" \n Orpo told journalists that he believed that it would be possible to agree on a government programme with SDP chair  Antti Rinne , adding that he was distancing himself from the concept of \"red lines\" that cannot be compromised. He noted that the larger the government’s majority the stronger its parliamentary base would be. \n \"I am distancing myself from that term. Responsible economic and employment policies are among the important issues for the NCP. However the NCP isn’t hankering after joining the government. It all depends on the policy programme,\" he noted. \n \"We will not join the government at any cost. It is possible for the NCP to participate in the work of government if we can create a shared and realistic picture of the state of the national economy. And agree on what kind of change the government wants to effect in Finland,\" he added. \n However he stressed that his party would not be the \"bad cop\" in government that always says \"no\". \n Commenting on the possibility of the Finns Party joining the governing coalition, Orpo said that the nationalist party’s election surge should be taken seriously. \"The NCP respects the election result,\" he remarked."}
{"text": "Finland's  parliamentary election  on Sunday has been touted by some as a victory for \"red-green\" female candidates. Red-green parties include the Social Democrats, Left Alliance and Greens. \n A total of 92 women were elected to national office in Finland this year - nine of them for the first time - making the country's incoming 200-member parliament 46 percent female. \n Depending on the source, Finland is generally ranked tenth in the world regarding lawmakers' gender balance, and this election helped to improve gender equality in Finnish national politics. \n Now, Finland trails just behind Sweden (by a tenth of a percentage point), a country which also recently saw an increase in females elected to parliament. \n Veteran MP  Janina Andersson  was just 24-years-old when she first won a seat in parliament in the mid-90s, says she was unsure of on-the-job etiquette at first. But she quickly learned the rules after making headlines for breastfeeding her child at Parliament House. \n \"In 1995 there was no room for babies in politics, but quite quickly the female Speaker of Parliament made arrangements for female MPs with a baby care room for mothers with children. It was a psychological win for me that something so wrong became completely acceptable,\" she said. \n Out of the Greens' 20 incoming representatives, 17 are women, a situation that Andersson doesn't consider balanced. \n \"I think there should be an even representation of ages and genders. When it comes to age [demographics] I think it looks very good, but within the Greens the gender split is rather lopsided and that's not good, either,\" Andersson. \n Fewer new young MPs, but average age dropped slightly \n The average age of Finland's next parliament dropped by a year, but at the same time the number of young MPs actually fell. \n Out of the 200 available seats they were vying for, only eight candidates under the age of 30 managed to get elected in Sunday's general election. \n The average age of incoming MPs is 46, while the average age of parliamentarians elected in the 2015 parliamentary election was 47.3. \n However, the age decrease was not prompted by a slew of millennial 20-somethings being elected - the number of incoming MPs under the age of 30 - eight of them -actually declined this year. \n In 2015 there were 14 MPs under 30 who were elected and in 2011 there were 11. \n The youngest incoming female MP this year will be the Greens' 24-year-old I iris Suomela ."}
{"text": "Green Party chair  Pekka Haavisto  has said that he would like to see his party join the incoming government, but noted that issues like education, climate and measures against social marginalisation need to be emphasised if it does. \n \"It is very important that the government is positive toward EU development,\" he added. \n On Tuesday Haavisto said he would not yet speculate on the various coalition-building possibilities that may take shape over the coming days. \n He said other matters - particularly the potential size of government's majority - need to be examined, for example whether it is even feasible to form a government with support from fewer than 110 MPs. \n After that's sorted out, Haavisto said, it will be time to begin considering government programmes. \n Finns Party cooperation? \n Haavisto was diplomatic about whether the Greens would join a government with the populist Finns Party, suggesting he thinks the two parties would not likely join forces. \n \"In that scenario, one side will need to change, and it's not the Greens,\" he said. \n Haavisto also said the work load of coalition building may be lightened by the Centre Party's change in leadership. On Tuesday outgoing Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä   announced he was leaving  his Centre Party chair post in September. \n Haavisto thanked Sipilä for cooperation in efforts that both parties worked on, specifically noting their work regarding climate policy. \n The Greens leader said he believes a government will be formed by the end of next month. \n EU elections loom \n Finland's EU Presidency period begins on 1 July, a situation that will likely help along the process of government formation in good time, he said, saying that Finland cannot afford to have freshly-minted ministers when it assumes the presidency. \n Sunday's elections brought five more Greens into parliament, for a total of 20. \n \"It is an interesting new group of three men and 17 women. Of the members, 14 are new and their range of ages is large,\" he said. \n He said last Sunday's good results for the Greens' female candidates will likely carry over to the party's leadership elections next month, and suggested that the party's next chair would likely be a woman. \n Haavisto reiterated that he still has no plans to run for the chair post himself, which the party will elect this summer. He  took over the job last autumn  after the party's previous chair  Touko Aalto  stepped down for health reasons. \n Edited at 7:52 pm 16 April 2019 to reflect that Haavisto said he thinks his party's next chair will be a woman."}
{"text": "Former Finns Party members who defected to other parties in 2017 did not fare well in Sunday's parliamentary elections,  writes tabloid Iltalehti . \n A group of defectors founded the Blue Reform group in summer 2017 to distance themselves from hard-right Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho . Their efforts were in vain, however, as nobody from Blue Reform managed to secure a seat in parliament on Sunday. \n While some MPs such as  Veera Ruoho  jumped straight to the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), long-term politician  Kaj Turunen  went a different route, as IL notes: he first defected from the Finns Party to Blue Reform (then called \"New Alternative\"), from whence he defected once more to the NCP, only to be ejected from parliament altogether. \n Turunen's support figures fell substantially since the previous parliamentary elections. In 2015 he received 6,929 votes, but on Sunday only 545 people voted for him. \n Ruoho said in IL that while she is grateful for the support she did receive (1,487 votes, more than a thousand fewer than in 2015) her time in the legislature was overshadowed by a harassment case. In 2017 Finns Party MP  Teuvo Hakkarainen  was  convicted of assault and sexual harassment  against Ruoho and ordered to pay 80 day fines. Ruoho received hate mail after the incident, Iltalehti writes. \n Ruoho said she will return to her profession as a police officer, calling her low support numbers \"a blessing for my family\". \n Rehabilitation, parental benefits to change \n Meanwhile regional daily  Aamulehti reports  that Finnish national pension institution Kela will change the way rehabilitation allowances, parental allowances and sickness benefits are determined. \n Previously  Kela calculated  the sums based on each recipient's annual income from the full previous calendar year's tax returns. Starting in 2020, the amount of benefits will be based on the recipient's income from the previous 12 months preceding the benefit decision, even mid-year. \n Kela said this method would bring allowances more in line with people's actual income levels, AL writes. \n Thieves caught by hidden tracker \n Daily Helsingin Sanomat writes  that two men in Vantaa were found guilty of aggravated theft on Tuesday after they systematically stole electronics from postal shipments in 2015 and 2016. \n The men, born in 1983 and 1969 and working for an outside logistics company, got away with 60,000 euros in phones and tablets while working at the primary Posti hub, HS writes. \n The duo was caught after a GPS tracking device in one of the shipments raised the postal service's suspicions. HS reports that video surveillance footage of the men improperly loading packages for their own purposes finally landed both men one year's probation each. \n Both workers appealed to have their sentences commuted, but the Helsinki Court of Appeal found no reason to change the original ruling."}
{"text": "Populism has come to Finland to stay and the days of big-three political parties shaping the government or the opposition are over, say analysts  Sini Korpinen  and  Sam Kingsley  as All Points North wraps up its special parliamentary election series. \n The populist Finns Party led by immigration hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho , swept into the top three to claim 39 seats and push Finnish politics hard right, with a voter mandate that Korpinen and Kingsley say other politicians and the general public should not ignore. That groundswell of support is what will complicate the task of coalition talks for  Antti Rinne , whose Social Democratic party claimed 40 seats and the commission to form a new government from the fragmented result. \n According to the experts, although  Petteri Orpo 's National Coalition Party and  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party -- which was soundly trounced in the poll -- are the only groups with any appetite for working with the Finns Party, sending them into opposition could ultimately lead more voters to rally to their side in subsequent elections. \n Overall, opposition parties the Greens and the Left Alliance look to be solid potential partners for the SDP, but their MPs may not be enough for a parliamentary majority. That means Rinne will likely have to invite other parties to join his administration, taking the new government in the direction of an unwieldy \"rainbow coalition\". \n Whatever happens, Finland can look forward to more thrills as coalition formation talks progress and a new government takes office just as Finland assumes the rotating EU presidency from 1 July. \n Back again after Easter with new content!  \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

{"text": "Business magazine Talouselämä reports that government formation talks will begin next week with SDP chair  Antti Rinne  sending a questionnaire to political parties. The Social Democrats want to know the parties' stance on issues such as the economy, climate and energy policy. \n As the biggest party in the election, the SDP will take the lead on government formation talks, though it will face pressure as it only gained one more seat in the new legislature than the Finns Party and two more than the National Coalition Party, writes TE. \n Talouselämä predicts that the Social Democrats will partner with the National Coalition party, though the NCP is likely to stick firmly to its election programme, which could prove troublesome for the SDP. \n Yle News' podcast  All Points North  released an episode on Wednesday that examines how party negotiations might play out, and which parties might ascend to government in the coming weeks. \n Church losing appeal \n Ahead of the Easter holiday, national daily  Helsingin Sanomat  reports that the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church continues to  lose members . Around 52 percent of Helsinki residents now belong to the church, down from some 62 percent in 2010. \n Helsinki has seven parishes in which fewer than half of residents belong to the church. HS noted that many newcomers to Finland have no connection with the state church. \n Sakari Enrold , rector of Kannelmäki parish in Helsinki, said the downward trend was likely to continue, but that a \"global catastrophe could encourage people to seek solace in churches.\" \n Leavers include people who find the church too conservative as well as those considering it  too liberal  on issues such as gender-neutral marriage. \n Multilingual kids enhance peer communication \n HS reports that some 20 percent of under school-age children in Helsinki speak a native language other than Finnish, Swedish or Sami. \n Families’ home languages, however, vary greatly by district. In Länsi-Pakila, northern Helsinki, Finland's domestic languages are the native tongue of 98 percent of kids, but the same is true for just 44 percent of children living in Kallahti in the east of the city. \n Helsinki estimates that by 2025, nearly a quarter of kids in daycare will speak a language other than Finnish or Swedish at home. \n Satu Koistinen , an educational expert with the city, said that polyglot immigrant-background kids are helping stave off the erosion of the Finnish language thanks to their linguistic agility which rubs off on their peers."}
{"text": "Finland's main political parties released their full lists of candidates for next month's European Parliament election. They include quite a few politicians who were just elected to the Finnish legislature this week. If elected to both bodies, they will have to pick one, leaving the other seat open to be filled by a runner-up deputy from their own party. \n The number of so-called 'double candidates' indicates that the parties have had difficulties attracting enough candidates for the back-to-back elections, says University of Helsinki political science researcher  Antti Ronkainen . \n Kerfuffle at Finns Party press event  \n Thursday was the deadline for Europarliamentary candidates to announce their intentions. One of the biggest remaining question marks was whether outgoing foreign minister  Timo Soini  would seek a seat in Strasbourg and Brussels. \n Soini co-founded the nationalist Finns Party, the second largest bloc in the new Finnish Parliament, but left the party two years to join the breakaway Blue Reform party – which did not win a single seat in last weekend's election. The party has vowed to press ahead anyway, but suffered a blow as Soini announced in a Thursday blog post that he is leaving politics. \n Three other former Blues ministers,  Sampo Terho ,  Jari Lindström  and  Jussi Niinistö , have also said they will not run, while two former Blues MPs,  Ari Jalonen  and  Kari Kulmala , will seek European seats along with seven other candidates. \n The Finns Party revealed its roster of candidates, headed by deputy chair and MP  Laura Huhtasaari . The rest of the list includes current MEP  Pirkko Ruohonen-Lerner ,two newly-elected MPs convicted of hate speech,  Teuvo Hakkarainen  and  Sebastian Tynkkynen , as well as  Mika Raatikainen , who just lost his seat in the Finnish Parliament after one term. He originally got that seat by replacing party chair  Jussi Halla-aho , another convicted hate speech offender, when the latter opted to join the European Parliament in 2014. \n At a press conference announcing the party's candidates on Thursday, a  Helsingin Sanomat  reporter asked Halla-aho about the old blog posts that earned him that conviction. Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne , who is beginning efforts to form a new government, cited the anti-immigrant posts twice this week as a potential obstacle to government cooperation between the SDP and the Finns Party. Halla-aho, however, refused to answer the journalist's question, ordering a staffer to take the microphone away from him and moving on to the next question. \n Veteran politicians and young hopefuls \n Leading the Social Democratic list are incumbent MEP  Miapetra Kumpula-Natri , former finance minister  Eero Heinäluoma , along with former MP  Satu Taavitsainen , Helsinki city councillor ' Husu' Hussein  and SDP youth wing chair and Rovaniemi city councillor  Mikkel Näkkäläjärvi . \n Candidates from outgoing prime minister  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party include  Mauri Pekkarinen  and  Pekka Puska , who have both just left Parliament, current MEPs  Elsi Katainen  and  Mirja Vehkaperä , as well as  Jouni Kemppainen , editor in chief of the rural newspaper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus and former news chief at Yle. \n The best-known Christian Democratic Party candidate is party chair, MP and former world-champion race walker  Sari Essayah . Others include MP  Peter Östman  and party secretary  Asmo Maanselkä . \n Essayah says that if she is elected to the European Parliament, she will return as an MEP during Finland's EU Presidency term in the second half of this year and then switch back to the Helsinki legislature. However if the small party is included in the next government coalition and she is offered a ministerial portfolio, she would then give up her MEP seat. \n The conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) announced its candidates earlier. Among them: present MEPs  Sirpa Pietikäinen ,  Petri Sarvamaa  and  Henna Virkkunen , as well as another former government minister,  Kimmo Sasi  and ex-MEP  Eija-Riitta Korhola . \n The main Green candidates are  MEP Heidi Hautala  and former environment minister  Ville Niinistö . Among the others is  Iiris Suomela , who was just elected as Finland's youngest MP. \n On the Left Alliance candidate list are  Hanna Sarkkinen , newly re-elected as an MP, and  Silvia Modig , who this week lost her seat in Helsinki, as well as current MEP and ex-transport minister  Merja Kyllönen . She too is a newly-elected MP who says she does not intend to return to Brussels even if she wins – apparently aiming to gather votes for the party to help fellow candidates vying for an EU seat. \n Meanwhile the small Swedish People's Party's best-known candidate is MEP and former presidential candidate and journalist  Nils Torvalds . \n 14th candidate may hang in limbo pending Brexit \n The European Parliament election is held in all EU member states between 23-26 May, in Finland on Sunday 26 May. Advance voting is available for  European citizens in Finland  15-21 May and for Finns abroad 15-18 May. Finns abroad may also now vote by mail-in absentee ballot. \n As it now appears that Britain will take part in the European election, Finns will elect 13 MEPs as before. However if the UK does eventually leave the EU, the candidate with the 14th-highest vote tally would then take Finland's new 14th seat in Brussels and Strasbourg. However it could take many months before the eventual size of the Finnish delegation is finalised. \n The European Parliament now has 751 MEPs with 73 from Britain. If the UK leaves the union, 27 of its seats will be distributed to other countries and 46 left empty. Finland was among those arguing that the extra seats should not be distributed, but that the legislature should simply be shrunk in size in the event of Brexit."}
{"text": "Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä 's Centre Party suffered a  historic defeat at the polls on 14 April  and its loss of 18 seats means it will also lose more than 2.6 million euros in political party funding from the state. \n Since 1967, the Finnish government has paid about 30 million euros annually – close to 150,000 euros per MP – to support the activities of Finland's parliamentary political parties. Half of the money awarded by the state each year is meant to support the party in general, and the other half is intended for use in the party's information and communication work. \n Because this support is distributed according to the number of parliamentary seats each party holds, the Centre Party will lose upwards of 2.6 million euros in funding, a loss that party secretary  Riikka Pirkkalainen  says will likely lead to restructuring. \n \"This means we will have to adapt, and of course, it feels bad,\" she said. \n Pirkkalainen said she can't say yet whether the loss will lead to a reduction in the number of personnel in its party offices or district organisations. \n \"Party leaders will make the final decision about any changes to the budget and where possible adjustments can be made,\" she said. \n The Centre Party will take a hard hit when it loses some of its government support, but it will not lead to an economic crisis, as the party's finances are now in order. \n \"After the 2011 election, the Centre Party was in much worse financial shape and had outstanding debt. During Juha Sipilä's term as chair, the party's finances were straightened out and so the situation is now better than it was before,\" Pirkkalainen said. \n Gains for parties winning new seats \n The Social Democratic Party (SDP) won 40 seats in the election, an increase that will translate into a 900,000-euro injection of more annual state support moving forward. This boost will bring state-funded support for the SDP up to around six million euros per year. \n Back in 2015, when the shoe was on the other foot and the SDP had its worst election result ever, it had to respond to the cut in funding by limiting the publication rate of its party bulletin, among other things. \n The Left Alliance won four more parliamentary seats, which means 600,000 more euros in yearly support, bringing their annual sum to almost 2.4 million euros. \n Success at the polls will also provide a welcome shot of support for the Green Party. With five new seats, they will receive 740,000 euros more each year in state funding, a 33 percent increase on their previous state funding amount. \n Green party secretary  Lasse Miettinen  says the boost is important because the Greens do not have large individual donors such as foundations. Finland's Greens have traditionally had to rely on donations from private donors to meet their expenses, in addition to annual state funding. \n Miettinen said the party hasn't decided yet on how to use its new resources, and expected that the next few months would be spent considering it. \n \"But I can say at this point that all of the money will be directed towards changing the world – in other words, taking us in the direction that our voters are hoping for,\" he said. \n Only slight improvement for Finns Party and NCP \n The Finns Party, with its third consecutive strong election showing, will receive only slightly more support from the state, as it picked up only one more parliamentary seat in the general election. Even so, its 39-seat total means it collects over 5.7 million euros in state support each year. \n Likewise, the National Coalition Party's one additional seat puts its annual support at slightly more than 5.5 million euros. \n The figures used to calculate the state funding changes in this report are from last year's government budget estimate. However, the final allocations may differ, as the new government coalition will determine the amount of annual support once it assumes office."}
{"text": "Finns Party communications chair  Jussi Halla-aho  did not respond to a question about an old blog post for which he was convicted for religious defamation and ethnic agitation -- instead calling on communications chief  Matti Putkonen  to remove the microphone from the journalist posing the question. \n The incident occurred during a party press conference on Thursday when Helsingin Sanomat reporter  Jarno Hartikainen  asked Halla-aho to comment on the blog writings, for which  Halla-aho was fined by Finland’s Supreme Court  in 2012. \n He asked the party chair whether the texts were the rash comments of an angry young man, and which do not reflect his opinions, or if he still stands by his comments. Hartikainen placed his question in the context of the party leader’s old writings \"appearing to complicate [government] negotiations\". \n The HS journalist was referring to Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne , who said following his narrow election victory last Sunday that he and Halla-aho had \"differences of opinion related to humanity\". On Monday, Rinne referenced Halla-aho’s writings once more in an interview with commercial broadcaster MTV, citing them as evidence of fundamental differences. \n The Finns Party  emerged from the nail-biting election with 39 seats , just behind the SDP's 40 seats and ahead of the National Coalition Party's 38, making the nationalist party a strong contender to be part of a government coalition. \n Journalist told to hand over mic \n During the press conference, Halla-aho began to respond to the question, saying that \"It’s rather difficult to take the excerpt out of its context...\" At this point, Hartikainen interrupted and offered to provide an excerpt on which Halla-aho could comment. However at this stage the event took a turn for the dramatic. \n \"No, no no,\" Halla-aho said, raising his voice, before calling on Putkonen to take the microphone away from the journalist. Putkonen complied and told Hartikainen to hand over the microphone. \n \"Enough of this. You posed your question, Halla-aho will answer and you will pass on the microphone,\" Putkonen instructed the journalist. \n \"You must comply with the rules here. We are not getting into these issues here,\" Halla-aho joined in. \n However Halla-aho did not respond to Hartikainen’s question and the hosts moved on to take other questions. \n In 2012, the Supreme Court ordered Halla-aho to pay a 50-day fine instead of a 30-day fine imposed by a lower court over the controversial blog post that he originally published in 2008. The Supreme Court said Halla-aho’s posts, which likened Islam to paedophilia and said Somalis are predisposed to stealing and living off welfare, qualified as inciting hatred against an ethnic group. \n In its ruling, the court said hate speech does not fall under the protection afforded by freedom of speech. The court also ordered Halla-aho to remove the comments from the blog. Two lower courts had previously dismissed the hate speech charges and convicted the defendant of religious defamation."}
{"text": "Fledgling politician  Hussein al-Taee , who was recently elected to  parliament on a Social Democratic Party ticket , has come under intense scrutiny over old Facebook posts about the situation in the Middle East. \n Among other things, the new MP from Vantaa appeared to compare Israel to the extremist group Isis and to endorse content posted by  a pro-Russia advocate who was sanctioned by Ukraine  over his apparent support for the illegal annexation of Crimea, according to reports last Thursday by STT news agency. \n Al-Taee has not disputed the veracity of his comments in the open Facebook group in which they were posted. \n \"I want to apologise for comparing Israel to Isis, because the comment was simply stupid and it does not in any way represent my opinions or values,\" al-Taee told STT. \n SDP party secretary  Antton Rönnholm  told STT that the party plans to discuss the matter with al-Taee after the Easter break. Rönnholm added that it is important for the SDP that the newly-minted lawmaker has apologised for his writings. \n Al-Taee received 4,000 votes in recently-concluded parliamentary elections, enough to gain a seat in the Uusimaa district. During his campaign, he said he was a conflict resolution professional and that he had often spoken at the parliament and at ministries in a professional capacity. \n Employer stands behind al-Taee \n Meanwhile, al-Taee has the backing of his employer,  Martti Ahtisaari ’s Crisis Management Initiative, an independent organisation that acts as a peace broker in global hotspots. \n Communications and fundraising director  Elina Lehtinen  told STT that the new MP’s work for the organisation had been impeccable and very successful. Lehtinen said that it was enough for CMI that al-Taee had apologised for any offence his comments may have caused. She added that she had discussed the matter with al-Taee himself, but had not reviewed the contentious comments in any detail. \n \"We have not gone through the comments in detail. It must be noted that the majority of the [public] comments are ones that he does not recognise as his own. There are clearly some elements that are deliberately being used to sabotage him,\" she remarked, declining to speculate who might want to harm al-Taee. \n \"In Iraq al-Taee has inspired confidence among parties to the conflict and has brought together representatives of three groups: Shiias, Sunnis and Kurds. There is nothing to suggest that his work has been in any way unethical,\" she declared. \n Lehtinen pointed out that no one works alone at CMI and that all projects are supervised by the organisation itself as well as donors. \"Conflict resolution is always [about] teamwork. Our credibility does not lie in the hands of one person.\" \n Lehtinen noted that given his new role as a member of parliament, al-Taee’s work at CMI will be on hold for the next four years. \"At the moment he has chosen this path and he will be an MP for the next four years. I don’t believe that he will be actively involved in any CMI projects,\" she commented. \n Facebook group run by pro-Russia actor \n One of al-Taee’s posts dates back to 2014, when he had already begun working at Ahtisaari’s Crisis Management Initiative. At the time, he addressed Sweden’s intention to recognise Palestine as an independent state. \n \"The countdown will now begin, we’ll see how the Swedish government will change and Stockholm or Malmö will really start to explode. The Mossad [Israeli intelligence service] will never forgive Sweden for this,\" he wrote. \n Al-Taee also repeatedly compared Israel’s actions to that of the extremist group Isis, according to STT. The group’s administrator and owner is  Janus Putkonen , who previously worked as editor of Verkkomedia.org, a website that described itself as a challenger of the mainstream media. The site offered Russia-friendly content as well as anti-vaxxer articles and was very critical of the USA and Israel. \n STT reported that Al-Taee commented frequently on Putkonen’s posts and links to Verkkomedia content without challenging the reliability of its sources. \"I’m not quite sure that I know even now who Janus Putkonen is, but I do not endorse his ideas. I think his worldview is quite distasteful and problematic. When I began to see the Russia-friendly slant, I didn’t get involved and I quit the group,\" al-Taee told STT last Thursday. \n In March,  Ukraine placed Putkonen on a sanctions list  for his role as an election observer in Russia-backed elections in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine. He was also a press centre chief in the region."}
{"text": "Chair of the nationalist Finns Party  Jussi Halla-aho  has not entirely distanced himself from old blog posts that resulted in his conviction on hate speech charges. Last week Halla-aho  did not answer questions from a Helsingin Sanomat reporter  who tried to ask whether or not the head of the populist party still stood by his writings. \n The reporter was ordered to hand over the microphone during the party press conference and his questions were not addressed. Halla-aho took to his blog on Saturday to address the issue. \n \"Some were foolish and imprudent comments. Some were the kinds of comments that you can make as a regular citizen but not as a politician. And others were the kind that taken out of context sound wild, but which had and still have a point,\" Halla-aho commented of the now-decade-old texts. \n Halla-aho \"tired of having to respond\" to posts \n Last week daily Helsingin Sanomat revisited those writings, which at the time resulted in a conviction for religious defamation and ethnic agitation and saw  the Supreme Court stiffen a lower court penalty  from a 30-day to a 50-day fine for the offences. The Supreme Court ruled that Halla-aho’s posts, which likened Islam to paedophilia and said Somalis are predisposed to stealing and living off welfare, qualified as inciting hatred against an ethnic group. \n The party chair also used his blog to address the incident last Thursday, in which he called for HS journalist  Jarno Hartikainen  to hand over the microphone when he tried to ask Halla-aho about his position on the old posts. \n The party leader said that the press conference, which had been organised to deal with upcoming European parliament elections, should not be used to go through his blogs in detail. \n \"The alternative was to take the microphone away from the reporter and give to another who had something to ask about the day’s theme.\" \n Halla-aho said that he was tired of always having to respond to his written opinions during elections, when according to him, people \"rediscover\" his blog, titled  Scripta . \n \"The fact that following any election, reporters attack the same phrases is a ritual and a compulsory move, nothing more,\" he wrote."}

{"text": "Government formation talks will officially begin on Friday, but discussions on the outlines of the next administration's economic policy are already underway -- and the nationalist Finns Party is involved,  tabloid daily Ilta-Sanomat reports  on Wednesday. \n \"No party has been excluded from the negotiations,\" a source told the paper. \n IS said that according to information it has obtained, Social Democratic Party (SDP) general secretary  Antton Rönnholm  is leading the intense negotiations behind the scenes and the economy is seen as one of the most difficult areas to find consensus. \n On Friday the SDP, which  narrowly won a mandate  to lead formation of a new government, will summon parliamentary groups and will provide them with a series of fundamental questions about the administration's programme for the next four years. \n The government is likely to comprise at least the SDP, led by ex-union boss  Antti Rinne , and the conservative National Coalition Party, chaired by outgoing Finance Minister  Petteri Orpo , according to IS. However it wrote that the populist Finns Party has not been ruled out, despite Rinne's comments suggesting that it may have been. \n \"With regard to the government's composition, everything is still open,\" the paper was told. \n Migri \"overstepped its authority\" \n The Finnish Immigration Service Migri recently received a slap on the wrist from the deputy chancellor of justice for directing officials to retain the passports of asylum applicants. Another tabloid, Iltalehti, reports Wednesday that  the deputy chancellor ruled that the immigration agency  overstepped its authority when it issued the guidance in 2016 and said further that the practice is not based in law. \n In summer 2016, Migri issued guidelines to the police and border guards, calling on them to retain passports or other travel documents submitted with asylum applications until the cases were either approved or rejected. The directive specifically targeted people seeking international protection and the National Police Board had in turn urged police departments to comply with the recommendation. \n The deputy chancellor began to investigate the practice following a complaint filed in 2017 by one applicant whose passport was taken by police officials. The deputy chancellor found that Migri's actions violated the principle of legality and that the practice of seizing a passport as part of the asylum process was a matter that required legislation. In other words, the decision to retain passports was a matter for lawmakers to decide, not Migri, IL wrote. \n Following the ruling by the deputy chancellor of justice, the Interior Ministry began preparing an amendment to legalise the practice. A new reform that will make it legal for police and border officials to seize the passports of asylum applicants will take effect from 1 June. \n Finns fittest among western nations \n Finns are in excellent physical shape, according to another IL report. The paper  picked up coverage of a new World Health Organisation study  carried by Business Insider Nordic, which found that although Uganda topped 168 countries in terms of citizens' fitness, Finland ranked first among rich western countries, where work requires less activity. \n IL writes that as recently as the 1960s, Finland led the rest of the world in terms of the prevalence of heart and vascular disease among men. However the situation has turned around, in part because people smoke significantly less than before and have healthier diets. But Finnish residents are also keener on looking after their bodies, IT noted. The WHO study suggests that 56 percent of residents aged 30 to 64 engage in at least one hour moderate physical activity every day. \n Business Insider Nordic also highlighted the popularity of Nordic walking in Finland and the fact that schools and workplaces encourage students and employees to exercise. \n  Time up for changing the clocks? \n Finland is hoping to use its rotating EU presidency to push through a final decision by EU member states  on giving up daylight saving time , says the southwest Finland-based Turun Sanomat. \n Although the European Parliament  endorsed the decision to abandon the biannual ritual back in March , the European Council, the body that defines the bloc's policy agenda, has yet to corral member states to adopt a conclusive stance on the issue. Finland hoped that this would happen during Romania's EU presidency during the first half of this year. \n \"Finland's goal is to also get an official decision at the level of the EU Council during its presidency through to the end of the year. It's not that simple, given that there are 27 member states and each of them will have to ask national parliaments and governments about the matter and then draft a national position, but we are aiming for a decision,\" said  Maria Rautavirta , a counselor with the transport and communications ministry. \n Rautavirta said that it would still be possible to call time on daylight saving time in 2021 if Finland is able to push through a final decision during its EU presidency. Once the EU Council upholds the EU Parliament's decision, each member state will determine whether to retain summer or winter (normal) time as standard. \n Finland  has already indicated support for adopting winter  time as permanent standard time. However Rautavirta said that the then-cabinet's support for winter time is only an initial position that can still be negotiated. \n \"The final position will come from parliament and it will then be implemented nationally,\" she added. \n A majority in neighbouring Estonia is said to back switching permanently to summer time, while studies show people in Finland prefer sticking with winter or normal time. Rautavirta noted that normal time would keep Finland in the same time zone with Estonia, while it would be one hour ahead of Sweden if winter time applies in all three locations. \n Edit: Updated at 11.16am to clarify how Finland would stand with respect to Estonia and Sweden if winter time becomes the norm throughout."}

As an example, Bruun claims that before the polls, no journalist pressed Halla-aho when he said he considered it illegal to help drowning children. \n Bruun said the Finns Party’s  immigration-centred party platform  dominated election debates, allowing the nationalist party to project 2,7000 asylum applications filed in 2018 as the country’s biggest problem. \n Now that Halla-aho is attempting to present a sanitised version of himself as the leader of Finland’s second-biggest party, the country’s media outlets have taken an interest in Halla-aho’s  blogs writings , but it’s too little, too late, writes Bruun. \n Finland's lost youth \n Business magazine  Talouselämä  picks up on  youth marginalisation , reporting that  improved employment figures  don't extend to young people who have fallen through the cracks or those struggling with mental health issues. \n Between 2016 and 2018, the number of 16 to 29-year-olds receiving disability pensions rose by nearly one thousand to 15,622, according to the Finnish Centre for Pensions. \n Some 20,000 children and young people currently risk multi-generational marginalisation, according to TE. \n Within at-risk groups, employment prospects have improved the most among young people with vocational schooling. \n Ticket disruptions \n National daily  Helsingin Sanomat  reminds readers that HRT’s  ticket overhaul  comes into effect on Saturday, 27 April at 4.30am.

{"text": "President  Sauli Niinistö  called on lawmakers to seek the common interest of the nation during an address to the  formal opening of parliament  on Thursday. He reminded MPs that during the past decade, the government has changed several times and that the \"old normal\" was for government policy to last four years. \n \"During this decade, we have already changed governments five times; on average, this is more than once every second year. The old normal was solid government policy shaped over a full four-year term,\" he declared. \n Niinistö urged the incoming government to stand behind joint decisions, rather than continue the divisive rhetoric of pre-election campaigning. \n \"It has been striking to hear, also outside the context of the health and social services reform, the Government Programme or a decision made by the Government being characterised as something that was 'our demand', whereas that was 'proposed by them',\" Niinistö said as he addressed MPs on Thursday. \n \"It is equally striking when you hear a Government decision being described as 'just the policy of this or that minister',\" he added. \n The president stressed that he would continue to maintain contacts with parliamentary group chairs. As he had done in the past he also extended an invitation to party leaders to joint discussions on security, one of the focal points of Finland’s EU presidency which begins in July. \n He urged EU member states to come together to identify areas of commonality rather than focus on internal squabbles within the bloc. \n \"The tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting, and Europe is facing external pressures and temptations from different directions. We can only thwart them together, within the framework of a well-functioning European Union. Otherwise we run the risk of allowing Europe to fall apart into different spheres of interest,\" Niinistö said. \n He noted that Finland and the rest of the EU will go to the polls in about one month to elect Europarliamentarians.

{"text": "As Finland returns to normal following a divisive general election result, parliamentary groups in the new session named Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne  as leader of government formation talks. Rinne was widely expected to assume the role, given  his party’s razor-thin victory  in the recently-concluded election. \n Speaking during a press conference on Friday, Rinne said that the timetable for the formation of a new government will run a few days later than originally anticipated. \n The party leader distributed a list of questions covering 11 key areas to all parliamentary groups in his bid to zoom in on the optimal candidates to invite to talks on establishing a coalition government. Party groups must turn in their responses by mid-day on Tuesday, 30 April. \n Follow-up discussions will then take place from 3-6 May. In such a case, formal government formation talks will not begin before Wednesday, 8 May. \n Rinne told journalists that he would need to at least have an idea of other parties’ economic policy positions before embarking on the first round of talks. He noted that the original goal was to be able to announce invitees to coalition negotiations after May Day on Friday, 3 May. However now, his target is to begin those discussions on Monday, 6 May. \n Basic income or means-tested benefits? \n Rinne’s laundry list of key issues reflects the SDP’s focus on areas such as equality, education and the economy. These themes were central to the party’s election campaign and formed the backbone of election promises to remedy massive cuts in education spending and to reduce inequality. \n Rinne’s questions seek to determine whether or not other political parties want to improve services and social benefits. They also aim to analyse whether or not other parties would fund spending on education and benefits by possible tax hikes or by curbing spending in other areas. \n Queries relating to benefits reform are meant to gauge other parties’ support for means-tested benefits, where applicants must prove their eligibility for support. This point will require the Greens and the Left Alliance to consider their support for a universal basic income as an alternative to the current system of benefits. \n Disclosing possible red lines \n With respect to employment and the labour market, Rinne will be looking to see if other groups want to support cooperation with employee and employer organisations. He will want to understand if they want to maintain the universally binding nature of collective bargaining agreements. Analysts are eagerly anticipating the views of the centre-right National Coalition Party and the Centre Party on this question. \n Other key areas the survey addresses include testing parties' commitment to mitigating climate change, strengthening Finland’s policy and its status in the global arena, maintaining internal security while safeguarding human rights in Finland. \n Rinne’s questions also ask for proposals to ensure economic growth in the face of climate change while considering mega trends such as urbanisation. The questionnaire also tackled boosting the employment rate above 75 percent, developing expertise, education and innovation while aiming to gauge positions on social and health care reform. \n Rinne has also asked parliamentary groups to disclose possible obstacles they may have to joining a government led by the SDP."}

Following its big election loss, a number of its most influential members think  it belongs in opposition . \n As for a SDP-Finns Party-led cabinet, Helsingin Sanomat points out that this would be hard, as a number of parties have announced they will not cooperate with the Finns Party. \n Regardless of which two parties form the core of a new government, they will need the inclusion of smaller parties in order to control a majority in parliament. And, for all the possible combinations, the inclusion of the Greens was the most popular choice in this poll. \n Centre response \n Oulu's  Kaleva  is among the papers today reporting the Centre Party's responses to a series of policy questions that may determine whether or not it could be a good fit in an SDP-led cabinet. \n Two of the key issues, according to Kaleva, are the party's call for an overhaul of Finland's parental leave system, and demands that taxes are not increased for entrepreneurs or corporations. \n The Centre Party stated that continuing positive development in the economy and employment requires that the next government makes commitments to a target of a 75 percent rate of employment and to balancing public finances by 2023. \n The paper quotes the chair of the Centre's parliamentary group,  Antti Kaikkonen , as saying that the threshold to the Centre Party's participation in a new government is, however, a high one. \n Prison violence \n Top officials at Finland's Criminal Sanctions Agency, the authority that operates the nation's prisons, say they are concerned about the deteriorating security situation behind bars, according to an article in Tuesday's  Turun Sanomat . \n This follows a report on Sunday by the news syndicate Lännen Media that an organised crime group, United Brotherhood,  is running an extensive drug trafficking operation  in Finland's prisons, leading to an escalation of violence. \n Criminal Sanctions Agency Development Manager  Pauli Nieminen  is quoted as saying that officials have been working to root out the problem with all the means at their disposal, but that \"It's a different matter whether or not we have been successful enough.\" \n However, Nieminen denied that the situation is out of control, saying that it has been more a matter of isolated incidents. \n The director of Riihimäki prison,  Pasi Oksa , told the paper that it is often forgotten that the prisons have a crime prevention function. \n \"Prisons are not, however, [sealed] bottles. Criminal acts, threats, extortion, and running gangs out of prisons are things we cannot ever completely eliminate. But, what we can do is to try to make it as difficult as possible,\" stated Oksa. \n Risky party trick \n Colourful helium-filled balloons are as much a part of the May Day celebrations in Finland as are student caps, picnics, and the Finnish take on mead known as  [sima]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima %28mead%29)_. \n And, once in a party mood, for some people it's hard to resist inhaling some of that helium in order to speak in a funny, squeaky \"Donald Duck\" voice. \n But, seriously, don't do it. It can be fatal, writes  Ilta-Sanomat . \n The paper reports on a press release from the Aga gas company pointing out that while helium is not poisonous, when inhaled it displaces oxygen in the lungs, lowering or at worst blocking oxygen intake. \n The gas can inhibit breathing reflexes, and just a few breaths of it can lead to suffocation and loss of consciousness. \n Ilta-Sanomat says that in such a case, check to see if the person is breathing, start first aid measures, phone the emergency centre and follow their instructions."}
{"text": "Times are changing, Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne  said to crowds gathered at downtown Helsinki’s Central Railway Station for annual May Day speeches. Rinne, who is  identifying possible coalition partners  to form a new government after edging a narrow victory in last month’s general election, declared that there will be no more \"legal enforcement\" affecting workers. \n \"A small country like Finland cannot afford to reject the culture of compromise and a contract society. We cannot afford a self-inflicted crisis of confidence,\" he commented, likely referring to the outgoing government’s  so-called social contract  that saw government transfer some social payments from employers to employees, lengthen working hours and cut holidays in the public sector in a bid to boost business competitiveness by cutting unit labour costs. \n Rinne also repeated a pledge that he’d made last May Day to introduce a 100-euro pension increase for low-income retirees. \n \"Society cannot stand by while the elderly are in distress. This is why we have called for a 100-euro increase for pensions below 1,400 euros over several years. Experts say this proposal alone would lift 55,000 pensioners out of poverty,\" Rinne declared. \n The SDP leader said that the outcome of the election proved that voters were tired of a conservative government. He said that it’s now time for a government of the future and called for reforms to secure economic growth that was socially and ecologically sustainable. \n \"I mean bold future reforms. Investments in science and research. Job creation. Caring. Social and health care services. Senior care. Child welfare. Support for the elderly,\" he continued. \n Rinne said that Europarliament elections due at the end of the month would determine the future of the EU. He noted that the failure of immigration policy had boosted the fortunes of the right in Europe. \n Finns Party’s Halla-aho slams fragmented party system \n Meanwhile over in Hesperia Park, Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  condemned what he described as Finland’s fragmented party system, which he said makes it difficult to form a majority government. Halla-aho’s party was  narrowly pipped at the election finish line  by Antti Rinne’s SDP, which won 40 seats to his party’s 39. \n The leader of the populist party pointed to Sweden’s system of bloc politics and the Danish model of a minority government as more functional approaches. He added that the results of the election should be reflected in the policies of the government that takes office and said that in the present system, small parties such as the Swedish Peoples Party wield too much influence. \n Story continues after photo. \n Jussi Halla-aho. Heikki Saukkomaa / Lehtikuva \n \"The fact that almost all parties in Finland can join with almost all others is clearly problematic from the perspective of voters' consumer protection rights. In such cases, voting has no real impact on decision-making and it is not at all possible to deduce from the election result what kinds of policies would be forthcoming,\" Halla-aho remarked. \n Green leader stresses climate targets \n Pekka Haavisto , chair of the Green Party, which made significant strides in the election to push its seat count up to 20, said that his party is not prepared to compromise on climate targets. \n “Climate targets are an issue on which we will not compromise. The continuity of life on the planet, our wellbeing, our economies are entirely dependent on our environment. Eight parties have signed up to the climate goal or keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees. I believe that it is possible to find consensus on ways to do that,” he told the gathering. \n Haavisto also listed climate change as one of the central issues in upcoming European Parliament elections. He said that Finland, Europe and the world need a strong EU that can deal with the challenges raised by climate change, the decline of bio-diversity and technological development. \n Left Alliance chair calls out \"inhumane\" activation model \n Speaking in the southwestern cities of Turku and Salo, Left Alliance chair  Li Andersson  called for an end low wages paid to foreign workers and the complete dismantling of what she described as the inhumane and failed activation model, which penalises job seekers in the labour market if they do not meet certain conditions for maintaining their unemployment benefits. She said it is not enough to get rid of the system, but said it is necessary to develop the local labour market as well as worker competence. \n Story continues after photo. \n Left Alliance chair Li Andersson. Roni Lehti / Lehtikuva \n \"The transformation of the labour market, the fragmentation of employee contracts and the growth in the demand for expertise means that people must have the option of self-directed study much more than today and the educational offering must be opened up at all levels of schooling,\" Andersson said. \n The party leader talked of the implementation at the European level of a Green New Deal model that would create new jobs by reducing emissions. The Left Alliance was one of the recent election's big winners adding four new parliamentary seats to take its complement of MPs to 16. \n Centre Party calls for support for families and pensioners \n Head of the Centre Party’s parliamentary group and a frontrunner  to replace Juha Sipilä as party chair  later this year,  Antti Kaikkonen , spoke to party faithful in Hyvinkää and Helsinki. He made a case for improving the incomes of families and pensioners. \n \"This country must be able to increase the incomes of all cash-strapped families, provide additional home assistance and preventive services and ensure that people have the option to choose their children’s care [services]. It must also ensure that no young people are lost after completing their primary education,\" he declared. \n Kaikkonen reminded SDP leader Rinne of the promise he made last year to increase the pensions of poor retirees by 100 euros. \n Essayah \"perplexed\" by coalition talks \n Christian Democratic Party chair  Sari Essayah  said that she was perplexed by the array of questions that SDP chair Antti Rinne posed a survey he sent to all parliamentary groups in a bid to identify possible government coalition partners. \n \"The complete absence of a few questions caught my eye. Economic and finance policy have been initially addressed in separate talks involving the four largest parties. This is a rather curious set-up given that it [economic and finance policy] is the basis of the government programme,\" she observed. \n Speaking at a gathering in Kuopio, Essayah said that her party indicated in its response to the survey that it would hardly join a government that would fundamentally undermine the profitability of work and entrepreneurship, likely referring to the SDP’s preference for hiking taxes to pay for social programmes. She added that from the perspective of families, three factors affect the profitability of work: income taxes, daycare fees and benefits."}
{"text": "Finland’s Office of the Prosecutor General has asked police to look into whether a preliminary investigation should be opened into inflammatory comments made by Social Democrat MP  Hussein al-Taee  several years ago on social media, according to tabloid newspaper Iltalehti. \n On Thursday afternoon it was reported that al-Taee had been admitted to hospital on Tuesday and that he was on sick leave. The anticipated duration of al-Taee’s sick leave was not disclosed but officially began on Thursday. He will not participate in parliamentary matters during his sick leave, according to the party. \n The election's biggest winner last month - by a very  slim margin  - the SDP is currently engaged  in initial government formation talks  with the major parliamentary groups. \n The SDP's parliamentary group chair  Antti Lindtman  said on Thursday the party would address possible repercussions al-Taee may face for his past inflammatory comments once he returns from sick leave. \n Denial then apology \n Al-Taee, who became a first-time MP in last month’s general election, admitted earlier this week that he was the author of several anti-Semitic, homophobic and racist comments on Facebook several years ago. He  apologised for the comments  in his blog and at a press conference on Monday. \n Last month news agency STT reported that in 2014, al-Taee had made controversial statements in Facebook posts about the situation in the Middle East, one of which suggesting that Israel and the US had trained Isis terrorists. \n Al-Taee apologised for that statement shortly after the STT article was published, but said other derogatory comments about Jews, Somalis, Sunni Muslims, and homosexuals attributed to him were part of a ploy to blackmail him. \n However he has since admitted that all of the comments in question were his own. \n Former employer, SDP’s reaction \n The SDP’s Party Secretary  Antton Rönnholm  told newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Monday the party had not been aware of the comments he now acknowledged making. \n Some members within the SDP’s parliamentary group have said they felt deceived by al-Taee, but the party has yet not made any decisions about possible disciplinary action in the matter. \n Before he running for parliament, al-Taee worked for the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI), a conflict resolution NGO founded by Nobel laureate and former Finnish President  Martti Ahtisaari . \n On Monday, political publication Verkkouutiset reported that the peace negotiation group had removed links related to al-Taee from its website, following the publication of an article in the Jerusalem Post headlined  ”Finnish MP under fire for comparing Israel to Isis”  on Sunday. \n CMI's director  Tuija Talvitie  said that she was contacted by the Jerusalem Post by email after the paper published its article about al-Taee. She told the paper that the CMI condemns any inappropriate or degrading comments about any ethnic, religious, national or other groups."}
{"text": "When politicians use extreme rhetoric, it becomes normalised and can be experienced on the streets where it affects people's lives, says journalist and social commentator  Aurora Lemma , who appeared on APN to discuss political discourse in Finland. \n Tampere University senior media researcher  Heikki Heikkilä  agreed, saying that the groups affected by extreme language include people working with grassroots organisations as well as people with multicultural backgrounds. \n The APN panel concurred that the media have an increasingly important role to play in helping audiences to parse political rhetoric. Heikkilä said that over the past decade many Finnish politicians have become rather proficient in the art of \"spin\" or propaganda, while Lemma noted that politicos are increasingly resorting to catch-phrases to mask xenophobia in language that seems neutral. \n Heikkilä also pointed out that although there is a great deal of diversity among Finnish journalists, the media need to do more work to introduce more than two voices in a bid to providing balanced reporting. \n Racism more an opinion than a fact \n Both analysts noted that social media channels have made it difficult for traditional media to work in what he called a \"hybrid media culture\". He called on journalists to exercise caution using social media content as part of their reporting and to be self-critical and open up their editorial decision-making more to the public. \n Heikkilä and Lemma noted that Finnish media tend not to call out racism in political discourse. Lemma said that it likely because in Finland, racism is seen as an opinion rather than an objective fact. \n New Social Democratic MP  Hussein al-Taee  recently came  under fire  for controversial Facebook posts he had made several years ago about the situation in the Middle East, while  several Finns Party members have been convicted for hate speech offences  by Finnish courts - party chair  Jussi Halla-aho   included . \n If you have any questions, or would like to share something on your mind, just contact us via WhatsApp on +358 44 421 0909, on our Facebook or Twitter account, or at yle.news@yle.fi. \n The All Points North podcast is a weekly look at what's going on in Finland.

He met with the Christian Democrats, Finns Party and Centre Party. On Monday, he will talk with the Greens, Left Alliance, Swedish People's Party as well as the National Coalition Party. \n Rinne, who was named by parliamentary groups to lead government formation talks given  his party’s razor-thin victory  in the general election, said he expects to know by Tuesday evening which parties will be a part of government formation talks. \n “We’ll know what the makeup will look like by Tuesday evening,” Rinne said. \n Despite some internal division, there’s interest within the Centre Party, which  lost over one-third of its seats  in the general election, to join the government, according to information obtained by Yle."}
{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat, the country's most widely-read newspaper, carries a  story  on how the parties chosen by Finland's next likely prime minister, Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne  on Tuesday will have long-ranging consequences for the country's future in terms of its system of social benefits, response to climate change and taxation. Rinne earlier committed himself to reaching a final decision on the parties he will invite to Helsinki's House of the Estates for government formation talks by Tuesday evening. \n The paper writes that \"today is an exciting day in politics\" because the decision the SDP leader makes about what parties to choose will have \"almost as much influence as the election results\", as even some parties that did not do as well in the elections might be chosen to participate in the negotiations. It says that the elections were so close and the field of political parties in Finland preceding the parliamentary elections was so fragmented that \"power is only now being meted out in earnest\". \n Rinne said in a Saturday interview in the paper that he was looking for an \"suitable friend\" from among the parties that had earned the next-best election results: the populist Finns Party, the centre-right National Coalition Party and the Centre Party. \n Shining a light on internet recesses \n The Joensuu-based paper Karjalainen features an  STT story  on cyberbullying, reporting on a recent study that discovered that only one in five parents in Finland knew if their children had been subject to online harassment and only one in four has done anything to prevent their children from being the target of cyberbullying. \n Teachers were found to be much better aware of cyberbullying than parents, with one in three having observed the phenomenon in their work. Both the 1,000-some parents and the over 400 teachers responding to the study's survey said they wished there were more digital tools available to safeguard and promote empathy online. \n Insurance company If's country director  Timo Harju  tells the paper that adult figures in children's lives cannot rely on apps to solve the problem, saying that families should do everything in their power to \"keep the lines of communication open\" and talk about the subject. \n Tracking down lead-foots \n The paper Etelä-Suomen Sanomat also  reports  this Tuesday that police in Finland are planning to start sending notices to Estonian drivers that have been caught speeding by traffic cameras in the country. Law enforcement says the crackdown will begin with Estonian residents because the clear majority of traffic violations by foreigners have been traced to vehicles registered in Estonia. \n The news agency Uutissuomalainen says offenders can expect their first notices in early June. The notice advises the receivers to pick up a ticket stating their fine at the police station in Helsinki's Malmi district. Finnish police cannot send the actual ticket to Estonia, as criminal penalties cannot be sent abroad. \n \"The notice will have a deadline and if the recipient doesn't respond by that time, we can put out a search notice for the individual,\"  Dennis Pasterstein , chief inspector and head of Helsinki Police Department's traffic safety unit, tells the paper. \n Another scorcher in store? \n And finally, the tabloid Iltalehti has the  first of the inevitable summer weather forecasts  that start popping up at this time of the year in Finland. The tabloid reports a prediction from the Weather Company that says that Europe is in for a hotter summer this year than normal. \n Foreca meteorologist  Joanna Rinne  says it is too early to say with any certainty how things will play out, but unseasonably warm temperatures in the south could indicate hotter summer temps are on the way, as southern and central parts of Europe are already heating up. She says Spain could even see the 40 degrees Celsius mark be broken this summer. \n Rinne predicts more high-pressure fronts over northern parts of Europe in the coming months, meaning clear skies. Last summer Finland had 63 days with temperatures over 20 degrees Celsius, the second-warmest summer in Finnish history. The warmest temperature of the season was recorded in the west coast city of Vaasa on 18 July, when the mercury rose to 33.7 degrees. \n The tabloid writes that a Nature Communications study from last August found that extremely high temperatures will be twice as likely in Finland and the rest of the Europe for the next five years due to climate change and a rise in surface temperatures of the planet."}
{"text": "Finland moved a step forward in the search for a new coalition government on Tuesday, as SDP leader  Antti Rinne  concluded talks with the centre-right National Coalition Party--but said that he would like to know whether the Centre Party would be interested in joining his government. \n Rinne is set to invite his preferred government partners to official talks on Wednesday, but as of Tuesday afternoon the situation remained unclear. \n Earlier the leader of the Centre Party’s parliamentary group,  Antti Kaikkonen , said after a meeting of his MPs that they had not yet decided on whether they were ready to hold talks on joining a Rinne-led government. A caucus of senior Centre Party figures were due to meet on Tuesday evening to hammer out their position on joining the government. \n \"It would be important for the whole picture that the Centre was also ready to join [the government],\" said Rinne. \n Rinne said the talks had gone well, but he would take his time before announcing on Wednesday which parties would be invited to attend official coalition-formation negotiations. \n Differences of opinion \n NCP leader  Petteri Orpo , meanwhile, said that his party and the SDP had a lot in common but also many differences of opinion. \n In elections on 14 April the SDP emerged as the biggest party with 40 seats in the 200-member unicameral parliament. The radical right-wing Finns Party won 39 seats while the centre-right National Coalition took 38. \n The Finns Party, which was thrown out of government in 2017 after hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho  took over as leader, has said it would be open to joining a government if it was ideologically compatible. However several parties including the SDP have said before the election that they could not envisage forming an administration with Halla-aho’s group. \n Orpo has since faced pushback from rank and file members and some MPs on the right of his party, who would like to keep the option kept open. He said on Tuesday that his party would not be willing to join a government that included the Left Alliance, however, and Rinne said that restriction remained in place. \n Traditionally the leader of the biggest party gets the first crack at forming a coalition among parties holding at least 101 seats in parliament, or trying to govern as a minority administration. \n Official government-formation talks will be held at the House of the Estates, the central Helsinki pile where representatives of the Tsarist-era Diet assembled between 1891 and 1907. \n This story is being updated"}
{"text": "Finnish MPs voted 128 to 37 on Tuesday to rearrange their seating arrangements. The radical right Finns Party will henceforth be positioned on the right hand flank of the legislature, in a move that was staunchly opposed by their MPs. \n The Swedish People’s Party had requested a switch to a more central position so that they could more easily access translation services, necessitating the Finns Party’s move. \n The office of the speaker had approved the new arrangements, but with opposition from the Finns Party fierce the measure was put to a vote on Tuesday after a motion from group leader Ville Tavio to retain the current seating arrangement. \n “You won’t shut us up by moving us to the far right,” said  Juha Mäenpää , a Finns Party MP. \n Far-right or not far-right? \n His intervention distilled the substance of the complaint: that the Finns Party should not be regarded as a far right party. Finnish media have tended to eschew that term for the party, but international outlets including the BBC and AFP have used it. \n Several Finns Party MPs including the leader have been convicted of incitement to ethnic hatred, while others have been criticised for attending events with neo-Nazi activists. In 2015 Oulu MP Olli Immonen shared a picture from a memorial event where he posed with members of the now-banned Nordic Resistance Movement, an extremist group many of whose members have been convicted of racist violence. \n With one eye on upcoming European elections, Finns Party MPs ranged far and wide in their topics for discussion, talking about immigration and old age care home staffing in addition to the matter at hand. \n SDP group leader Antti Lindtman was bemused at the row. \n “If a place to the right of the National Coalition is okay in the European Parliament and in the Nordic Council is okay for the party, then why is it unacceptable here?” he asked rhetorically."}
{"text": "Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne  was due to announce which Finnish political parties he wants to begin government negotiations with before midday on Wednesday, and Centre Party MPs took to social media to figure out whether joining with the democrats would be a good idea. \n Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat wrote  that top Centre Party politicians  Katri Kulumni ,  Mikko Kärnä  and ex-PM  Matti Vanhanen  posted social media updates and polls on Tuesday asking their Facebook friends and followers whether to enter the coming government coalition. \n Rinne was due an answer as to the Centre Party's plans on Tuesday, but instead the party announced it would \"gauge its base\" before answering. IS wrote that MPs had until 9 am on Wednesday to reply yes or no to a web questionnaire. \n \"It looks like the election victors are not going to have a workable majority, so people are looking to the Centre Party. It's a simple question: should the Centre Party be prepared to enter coalition negotiations?\" wrote Vanhanen late on Tuesday. \n Responses to Vanhanen's and Kulumni's queries were mostly supportive of joining a coalition, while Kärnä's more formal poll had received almost 70 percent negative votes by Wednesday morning. \n The official web questionnaire will determine what the Centre Party does, IS wrote, with the party's parliamentary group chair  Antti Kaikkonen  saying the results \"would be respected\". \n Falling interest in metalwork training \n Machinists and welders are in short supply in Finland as an industry-wide slump has caused interest in the work to wane,  wrote daily Turun Sanomat . Various companies are turning to foreign workers and international programmes to make sure their factories remain adequately staffed. \n Engineering company Skoda Transtech out of Kainuu, for instance, constructs trams for the tramlines in Helsinki and soon Tampere, too. TS wrote that half of the firm's 150 welders come from abroad, mainly from Russia and Poland, and mainly gaining employment through temping agencies or labour banks. \n Transtech CEO  Lasse Orre  said one solution would be to bring welding training programmes right to Russia, specifically to the industrial town of Kostomuksha near Finland's eastern border. \n \"We have to figure out where to find welders, and Finnish people don't seem to care for the work,\" Orre said. \n The situation is not rosy at shipbuilding company Meyer Turku, either. Most of the workers are in-house employees, but now not even the basic training courses can be filled. \n \"We started an intro course for plater-welders in March, and we were supposed to have one in the summer, but we had to cancel that,\" Meyer Turku publicist  Tapani Mylly  said in TS. \"Let's hope there'll be more interest in the autumn.\" \n Dodgy school guidelines \n Meanwhile  newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reported  on a reader survey that found one in four parents have come across official school rules or guidelines about student behaviour that are prohibitively or even illegally strict. \n The paper wrote on Monday that a school in Tampere had sent around a form for parents to fill out ahead of a children's field trip. The form indicated that misbehaving students would be sent home with a guardian by bus, train or taxi – no matter how far away the destination is from the school district. \n For instance, a cab ride from Helsinki's popular Linnanmäki amusement park back to Tampere would have the cost the parents of a child from that school some 300 euros. The school's principal  Sirpa Raevaara  admitted in HS that the form was a mistake. \n \"I admit that such a form was in fact sent to parents. We follow the Finnish National Agency for Education rules, and guidelines like these are prohibited,\" Raevaara said. \n The punitive money-related measures are against the Finnish constitution and the right to free basic education, according to education agency administrator  Matti Lahtinen ."}
{"text": "Social Democratic Party (SDP) chair  Antti Rinne , placed in charge of forming a new government, has announced which parties are to enter formal negotiations. At a press conference late Wednesday morning, he confirmed that the parties entering government coalition talks with the SDP will be the Centre Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party (SPP). \n The parties that came in close second and third places in last month's elections - the nationalist Finns Party and the the conservative National Coalition Party - appear to be heading into the opposition. \n The leaders of the five parties launched negotiations at 2pm Wednesday at the House of Estates in Helsinki's Kruununhaka district. \n Centre Party chair and outgoing PM  Juha Sipilä  said earlier in the morning that his party was ready to enter talks on forming the next government coalition. \n Sipilä tweeted that eight out of 10 Centre Party leaders polled said the party should try for another cabinet term – despite their heavy losses in last month's parliamentary election. \n \"Eighty percent of the party's council, board and parliamentary group members support entering government formation negotiations on the condition that the Centre's threshold questions are met. Twenty percent opposed joining government talks. I have informed Antti Rinne,\" Sipilä said on Twitter shortly after 10 am. \n The Centre Party has published a list of 10 threshold demands for the new government agenda. They include targets of 75 percent employment rate and balanced public finances by 2023, no increases in corporate taxes, no increase on farmers' financial burden, reform of regional administration into 18 provinces to support health and social services reform ( known as sote ), increases for small pensions and \"moderate\" increases in logging and \"sustainable forest use\". \n After Rinne's press conference, Sipilä said that the Centre Party chair would certainly be a member of the new cabinet, but that it will not be him for long. After the election loss, Sipilä announced that he would step down and called a party congress for 7 September to elect a new leader. \n Five-party coalition would hold 117 seats \n Yle reported earlier that besides the SDP and the Centre, the parties in the government coalition talks will be the Greens, the Left Alliance and the SPP. \n They would have a solid majority of 117 seats in the 200-seat Parliament. \n The SDP narrowly won April's election, securing 40 seats in Parliament, just ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 39 seats and the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) with 38. \n The Centre Party suffered a historic defeat, losing 18 seats for a new total of just 31. That spurred many party faithful to say that the party should sit out the next legislative term among the opposition ranks. \n The Greens and Left Alliance gained seats for totals of 20 and 16 respectively, while the centrist SPP held on to its 10 seats, including a representative from the autonomous Åland Islands who votes with the bloc. \n Rinne's decision indicates he was unable to agree on basic principles in this week's talks with the NCP. Political analysts such as Yle's  Paula Pokkinen  say that the right-leaning, pro-business NCP would be unlikely to fit into the same cabinet as the Left Alliance, one of the parties that gained seats in the election and which has traditionally been ideologically close to the SDP. \n Another Yle political commentator,  Ari Hakahuhta , notes that former union boss Rinne was still weighing last night whether to pick the NCP or Centre as his main partner in talks, but apparently decided that the SDP would be more likely to achieve its electoral promises in tandem with the Centre than the NCP. \n And an alliance with populist immigration hardliners the Finns Party was always seen as unlikely. The party's chair, likely future opposition leader  Jussi Halla-Aho , did not attend Rinne's press conference, although NCP chair  Petteri Orpo  did. \n Interviewed by Yle afterwards, Halla-aho predicted that the government would carry out \"red-green policies\" including \"irresponsible, generous immigration policies\". \n Orpo told the news agency STT that he believes the NCP can carry out opposition politics along with the Finns Party. \n \"For instance, we have very similar views on economic policy. That is one example of an area where we can cooperate,\" the conservative leader said. \n 12:13pm updated throughout, corrected number of potential coalition seats \n 12:42pm updated with party leaders' comments and launch of talks"}

He is to step down from his post as Centre chair when a new leader is elected in September. \n One likely contender for that post, parliamentary group leader  Antti Kaikkonen , was among those replacing him at Thursday's Helsinki talks. So far all Centre MPs are taking part. \n Story continues after photo. \n Antti Kaikkonen Jouni Immonen / Yle \n The party decided to join the talks on Wednesday morning after a straw poll of party leaders around the country. \n \"We haven't had much time to prepare for this, because just 24 hours ago we didn't know that we'd be here,\" Kaikkonen told Yle. \n Conflicts loom over Centre demands \n Kaikkonen stressed that the party still has 10 'threshold issues' that it aims to have included in the next government's programme as a condition for moving forward. \n They include demands that may be difficult for other potential partners to swallow, such as pushing ahead with a provincial administration overhaul that was  central to the failed sote reform , and an increase in logging. That would likely reduce the country's  carbon sinks , undermining the ambitious climate goals of the Greens and Left Alliance. \n Story continues after photo. \n Party chairs Haavisto, Henriksson, Rinne, Andersson and Sipilä spoke to reporters before the latter left for an EU meeting. Vesa Moilanen / Lehtikuva \n The Centre and the Greens also have sharply differing proposals for reform of parental benefits, while the Left disagrees with the Centre's views on corporate taxes and subsidies. Meanwhile the SDP wants to change or rescind the so-called  activation model employment scheme , key legislation pushed through by the past Centre-led government. \n \"Dark clouds on the horizon\" \n As talks began on Wednesday afternoon, some 200 party officials heard from an array of experts on eight central themes such as the economy, climate and social and health care. \n On the economy, Rinne cited the latest Finance Ministry forecast. \n \"The starting point is that there are dark clouds on the horizon, both globally and in the European economy, with Brexit, the Italian economy and even Germany's situation. These must of course be taken into consideration in economic policy,\" the SDP chair said."}

The rest, nearly one in three respondents, are neutral on the issue. \n The business think-tank has gauged Finns' attitudes on the EU since 1988 – seven years before the country joined the Union. The positive rating in the latest survey was the highest ever, while the negative rating was the lowest ever. The current 56-13 ratio has only been approached once before, in 2012 when the ratio was 55-20. \n Finns Party, Christian Dems most eurosceptic \n Anti-EU feelings were at their highest – 35 percent – in 2000 and 2007, according to similar polls. \n As the UK's chaotic Brexit process plays out, Finnish respondents' desire for a \"Fixit\" or departure from the EU has hit a rock-bottom level of 14 percent. \n The biggest increase in EU popularity since the turn of the millennium has been among supporters of the Centre, SDP and Left Alliance parties, which are among those now seeking to form a new government coalition. \n There are only two parties where a majority of supporters take a negative view of the EU: the Finns Party and the Christian Democrats, both of which appear to be heading into the opposition for the next legislative term. \n Young adults pro-EU \n The highest levels of EU support is among backers of the conservative National Coalition Party, the Greens and the Swedish People's Party. \n Men tend to be more pro-EU than women, and support rises along with respondents' level of education and socio-economic status. Respondents aged 18-25 reported the highest level of EU positivity. \n The survey results are based on replies from just over 2,000 people aged 18-70 in January and February. Taloustutkimus estimates the margin of error at 2-3 percentage points."}
{"text": "Finland will not be signing a declaration by nine other EU countries calling for the rapid reduction of greenhouse gases across the union. \n The letter's signatories propose that the European Union commit to becoming carbon neutral by the year 2050 and direct a quarter of its next seven-year budget to combat global warming. \n The joint letter was released at a summit in Sibiu, Romania, on Wednesday. The climate stance was signed by the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Latvia, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Germany, the EU's largest member state, and all of Eastern Europe are also not among the signers. \n Outgoing caretaker prime minister  Juha Sipilä  said he refused to sign the letter because of Finland's upcoming EU presidency, which begins in July. \n \"We're so close to Finland taking up the chair that we have to avoid joining in letters like these,\" he said. \"We must make compromises. This is the only reason we are not involved.\" \n No discussion \n Despite not signing the climate demands, Sipilä still claimed that Finland is committed in principle to more ambitious climate policies. \n Parliament's Grand Committee did not discuss the letter while preparing for the Sibiu summit, nor have there been any inter-party talks on the matter since the parliamentary elections. Yle sources said that both the Social Democratic Party and the Green League consider the prime minister's avoidance of the climate letter problematic. The two parties are now engaged in government formation talks with Sipilä's Centre Party. \n Sipilä said he believes that as EU president, Finland could promote some sort of compromise, but he went on to call the attitudes of many member countries \"very uncooperative\". \n \"Finland has some aces up its sleeve,\" Sipilä said. \n The outgoing premier said his personal goal is to see a carbon-neutral EU by 2050, as the letter insists. \n Last December every Finnish political party except for the Finns Party promised to pursue stricter European emissions targets. However, Finland was also one of the few EU countries where emissions actually rose last year (+1.9%),  according to Eurostat . \n Environment Minister: Refusal won't affect Finland's policies \n Kimmo Tiilikainen , Environment Minister for the interim government, said on Friday that not signing the climate letter was the correct move for Sipilä and will not affect Finland's climate politics in the EU at all. \n \"Finland is for carbon neutrality by 2050. That official position is clear to everyone,\" Tiilikainen said. \n The minister said that staying out of the climate missive is in line with good EU presidency practices; the incoming chair ought not join in smaller coalitions of countries, Tiilikainen said, for the sake of streamlining the presidency. \n \"We have to learn the unwritten rules of EU decision-making and how to serve the union successfully. There's still a ways to go,\" he added."}

{"text": "The Social Democratic Party (SDP), which won  last month's parliamentary election  by a whisker and is  now trying to form a new government , appears to have lost its status as the nation's most popular party. That is according to an Yle/Taloustutkimus poll released Friday. \n The first public opinion poll since the election indicates that the top spot now belongs to the nationalist Finns Party. They are now poised to be the main opposition party during the next four-year legislative term. According to the survey, support for the populist party has risen to 18.8 percent, 1.3 percentage points higher than their election result. \n SDP support stands at 17.8 percent, about the same as their ballot result in April. Support for the third-place conservative National Coalition Party (NCP), 16.9 percent, is also about the same as their election result. \n A Helsingin Sanomat/Gallup poll published on Monday also showed the Finns in first place, followed by the NCP and then the SDP, with the Greens in fourth ahead of the Centre. \n The Yle poll also shows growth for the Greens, rising by 1.8 percentage points since the election to 13.3 percent – neck-and-neck with the Centre. The two parties will be partners in the next coalition government if cabinet formation talks proceed as planned. \n Also taking part in the SDP-led government negotiations are the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party. They both slightly lost support since the election, now at eight and four percent respectively. There were no significant changes in support for the smaller parliamentary groups. \n Bandwagon effect \n According to Taloustutkimus research chief  Tuomo Turja , the survey results are unsurprising, as parties that succeed in elections usually show a bump in support in the first public opinion polls afterwards. \n Turja refers to this as a bandwagon phenomenon. He says this has benefited the Finns Party and the Greens, but not the SDP, whose election result was weaker than expected. After leading polls by a comfortable margin for nearly a year, they eventually only won the election by one seat ahead of the Finns Party \n The biggest loser of the election, however, was the Centre Party of outgoing caretaker prime minister  Juha Sipilä . According to the poll, its support has continued to slide, down a further half a percentage point more to 13.3 percent. The data in this poll was collected between 15 April and 7 May, before the Centre Party agreed to join coalition talks. \n Taloustutkimus interviewed nearly 2,000 people. It estimates the margin of error at +/- 2.3 percentage points for the larger parties."}
{"text": "Professor  Markku Jokisipilä , director of the University of Turku's Centre for Parliamentary Studies, says that Finnish government formation talks may end soon. \n \"I have a feeling that this may be wrapped up quite rapidly. It seems that there is political will among the groups taking part in the government discussions,\" he told Yle on Friday. \n Negotiations aimed at putting together a cabinet to govern Finland for the next four years began on Wednesday at Helsinki's historic House of the Estates. \n Social Democratic Party (SDP) chair  Antti Rinne , whose party won last month's parliamentary election by a razor-thin margin, choose the Centre Party of outgoing premier  Juha Sipilä  as his main partner in a planned five-party centre-left coalition. He also held extensive talks with the leader of the conservative, pro-business National Coalition Party (NCP), which is the Centre's main partner in the outgoing government. \n The three smaller parties taking part are the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party. On Thursday evening, after the first full day of talks, Rinne said all was going according to plan. \n Jokisipilä argues those participating in the talks are motivated to succeed because there are really no other alternative government parties. \n \"If one of the [parties] marches out or is kicked out, then in practical terms the only alternative would be the NCP. And if the NCP joins the negotiations, it would mean that the Left Alliance would have to leave,\" says the pundit, suggesting that the gaps between the two parties' stands on economic and other issues are too wide to be bridged within one cabinet. \n \"Finns Party declared unfit for government\" \n If that happens, the situation would become very difficult, Jokisipilä says. \n \"I'd say there is probably no other alternative basis for a government. All the parties at the House of Estates certainly realise that. After all, the Finns Party has in practice been declared unfit for government by the other parties,\" Jokisipilä says. \n The nationalist party was in effect booted from the last government in 2017 when it elected a new chair,  Jussi Halla-aho , an anti-immigration hardliner who had been convicted of hate speech. They were replaced in the cabinet by a more moderate faction that split off from the Finns Party - and which failed to win a single seat in the new parliament. \n Meanwhile Halla-aho's Finns Party is now one seat short of being the largest bloc in the legislature, and topped two public opinion polls issued this week. Also this week they were moved – symbolically and against their will – to sit on the far right side of the parliamentary hall. \n Finland takes over the rotating EU presidency on July 1, and much of the country begins summer holidays on or around Midsummer's Eve (June 21), so Rinne is likely aiming to have a new cabinet sworn in by then. \n Four years ago, Sipilä's three-party government took office on 29 May after April elections. On 8 March this year Sipilä tendered the government's resignation after the collapse of its flagship legislation, a sweeping reform of the social and healthcare system and the nation's regional administration structure. Since then, his cabinet has carried on in a caretaker capacity."}
{"text": "Appearing on Yle's Ykkösaamu TV programme on Saturday morning, Finland's President, Sauli Niinistö, said he was closely monitoring  ongoing government formation talks  via the country's various media channels, and specifically looked forward to hearing some outlines of the economic policies proposed from the  prospective coalition partners . \n \"Sometimes you hear talk of 'that's enough saving for now', but I understand savings to mean actually saving something, and this hasn't happened [in Finland] for ten years. Quite the contrary,\" the president said. \n He admitted that Finland's policies are exceedingly dependent on what is happening in the rest of the world, but said the economic forecasts are not the best. \n Leadership required on the environment \n Environmental goals are another discussion item in the coalition talks, and Niinistö says it is not his place to interfere. He said he did however wish to comment on claims he has heard about Finland being \"too small a player\" to make a difference with its environmental policies. \n \"Now that Finland has taken over the EU Presidency, we must be able to say to the other EU countries that 'we have to' and not 'you have to',\" Niinistö said. \n And before Finland can says these things with any credibility before the EU, and the EU for that matter to the rest of the world, there must be clear accomplishments to back it up, the president continued. Finland has to send a clear signal, he said. \n True commitment to the agenda \n Finland's President also continued his campaign to promote government stability after years of cabinet breakdowns. He said that once a potential coalition agrees on a shared agenda for the next four years, they need to stick with it – no matter how bitter it might taste from time to time. \n \"Committing to the Government Programme is even more important than arriving at an agreement on its points,\" Niinistö said. \n He says that he remembers from his  own time in government  that everyone in the coalition was on the same mission. \n \"We were all heading in the same direction. We understood the basic problems and we were fixing them. It would be a good sign if the new government sets out with this kind of mindset,\" he said. \n The glue that will hold things together will be found – if it can be found – during the tough moments in the negotiation sessions, when people lock horns, perhaps heatedly, and after long debates decide to reach a solution together, the president said. \n An emphasis on multilateralism \n Niinistö says he is looking forward to continuing the Finnish tradition of meeting with the parliamentary party leaders to discuss foreign and security policy issues that are the constitutional mandate of the president. He says it is important to hear the opinions of the opposition at these meetings as well. \n The Finnish President says he doesn't expect any significant changes in Finland's foreign policy, but he would perhaps consider a change in focus towards an alliance of multiple equally-weighted countries pursuing a common goal. \n \"Emphasizing multilateralism is now of the utmost importance. The world has to return to a multilateral system. The only way to solve climate change and development questions is to discuss these things together.\" \n Countries should not only respect one another, but also multinational organisations like the United Nations. Otherwise, it will be difficult to make any progress, Niinistö said."}

Residents are now more interested in seeing how the new government shapes up than considering intangible EU issues. Just 39.1 percent of Finns cast their vote in the previous European parliament contest five years ago. \n Climate is a central theme in the European elections, a fact that KL says may encourage a higher youth voter turnout. \n Households getting deeper into debt \n Helsingin Sanomat ’s leader picks up on the Bank of Finland’s concern that Finnish households have become too indebted, partly because of the illusion housing company loans provide. The central banks say housing company loans have grown at an annual rate of 10 percent in the past decade. \n Today many new apartments in Finland's bigger cities can be purchased with a modest upfront payment that represents just a small portion of the home's nominal value. The bulk of the sale price then becomes a loan paid back to the housing company over time. \n The central bank wants to see limits on the total amount of debt available to households. In the past 20 years, Finnish households’ debt-to-income ratio has roughly doubled to 127 percent--a figure that is, however, still relatively low compared to the other Nordics."}

{"text": "The Helsinki tabloid  Iltalehti  writes that last week the parties in government formation talks spent their time examining the lay of the land and creating visions of the future. This week, it says, they will have to deal with economic and political realities. \n In a listing of some of the key points a new government programme will have to tackle, Iltalehti argues that a reform of health and social services will be the biggest and most important task at hand. \n The SDP, the Centre, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party involved in the talks have very different concepts of how the social safety net should be revamped. The SDP's  Antti Rinne , who is leading government formation talks, has pledged that reforms will be prepared by parliament, but this newspaper expresses doubts that it will be any easier that way. \n Among the other issues that Iltalehti believes will be causing headaches for negotiators are forestry policy, taxation and changes to the system of parental leave. \n One of the redline demands by the Centre is that higher taxes are not imposed by a new government on businesses and entrepreneurs. The SDP wants to target tax relief on small and mid-sized businesses and to more heavily tax the dividends paid out by unlisted companies, as well as more generally, ownership and capital. \n This leads the paper to the question: which party will give in? The Centre has announced that it will not back away a single inch from its key demands. Iltalehti though wonders whether or not it already has done so behind closed doors. \n Reining in lobbyists \n Tensions rose in the government formation talks last week over claims that lobby group representatives had been named by some of the parties to take part in formulating the programme for a new coalition. \n Although Social Democratic Party chair and government coalition manager Antti Rinne  rebuffed those claims , concerns about the role of lobbyists in Finnish politics are still very much alive. \n The agrarian paper  Maaseudun Tulevaisuus  writes that Rinne says that all of the parties in the talks have agreed on presenting parliament with legislation to set up a register of lobbyists. \n According to Centre chair and outgoing PM  Juha Sipilä , the cabinet office and parliament have both carried out work on establishing a registry of organizations and individuals involved in political lobbying. Rinne stated Monday that the work will move ahead and that he expects that a new law could be brought into force quite quickly. \n EU paradox \n Pointing to news that only  about 10 percent of young residents in Finland between the ages of 18-24 voted in the last EU parliamentary election , the daily  Helsingin Sanomat  reports one expert as calling this a \"special paradox\". \n This paper says that this past winter and now into the spring, young people have been calling for more powerful action to combat climate change. The young want long-term solutions from politicians. \n If there is one place where Finns have been able to influence climate change on a global level and the direction of Europe, that place is in the decision-making bodies of the European Union, writes HS. \n It is thus a \"strange equation\" when only 10 percent of young Finns voted in the 2014 parliamentary election. \n \"Taking into consideration how intelligent and well educated our young people are, and in fact how well aware they are of European affairs, this is a special paradox,\" the head of Finland's EU parliament mission office Jarmo Oikarinen told the paper. \n Looking for an explanation, Oikarinen said that some of the reasons may be that decision making in Brussels seems so far away, that EU affairs have low visibility in the Finnish media, and that the most concrete decisions, such as how tax revenues are spent, are made on the national level. \n Tax day part II \n Kuopio's  Savon Sanomat reminds readers  that today, Tuesday 14 May, is the deadline for many people to file corrections or additions to the pre-completed tax return forms received by mail earlier this year. \n Dates for filing with the tax authority are staggered, with one already passed on 7 May, one today, and one on 21 May. The deadline date is marked on the forms and is also available online at the tax office's \"MyTax\" (Omavero) service. \n If there is no need for corrections or additions to your return, you do not have to do anything. \n Digital driving licence  \n Iltalehti  reports that the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Traficom on Monday launched the beta version an android app that allows drivers to carry a legal copy of their driving licence on their mobile phones. \n The app displays an up-to-date copy of the driver's licence that, at least for the time being, is valid only in mainland Finland. \n According to Traficom, the virtual licence is intended to be used just like a printed one. Traficom points out, though, that it may not be accepted as ID, for example at sales points, until it becomes more widely used. \n The mobile phone licence has a number of security features including an animated background, colour-shifting holograms and a QR code."}
{"text": "Turku's  Turun Sanomat  is among the papers reporting that SDP chair  Antti Rinne  is optimistic that the government formation talks he is leading will produce a programme for a new ruling coalition by week's end. \n However, Rinne also stated that even if a programme is ready by Friday, that will not necessarily mean he will be able to announce a new government. \n Before that final step, Rinne plans on holding a two-day seminar for MPs of the parties in the talks to make sure that they understand what has been agreed upon and to get their commitment to supporting government policies. \n On Sunday, the SDP leader denied that the closed-door negotiations have been difficult. Turun Sanomat reports that talks have focused on plans for  at least 700 million euros in tax increases . These revenues are said to be earmarked for measures fulfilling campaign promises to improve spending on education, pensions and care for the elderly. \n Greens in the lead \n The daily Helsingin Sanomat carries  a voter survey  showing that two Green League candidates,  Ville Niinistö  and  Heidi Hautala  are the most popular candidates in next Sunday's EU Parliament elections. \n Niinistö is a former MP, Green League chairman, and government minister. Hautala is currently the Greens' only MEP. \n Third in this poll of more than 1,000 voters is former SDP Member of Parliament  Eero Heinäluoma . \n Finnish voters will be electing 13+1 members to the European Parliament. This means that 13 of the candidates elected will take up their posts when the European Parliament reconvenes, and a 14th Finnish MEP will join their ranks if and when the UK leaves the EU and the seats it currently holds are redistributed. \n At present, the conservative National Coalition Party and the Centre Party each have three MEPs, the SDP and Finns Party two each, while the Left Alliance, Greens and Swedish People's Party have one apiece. \n Meanwhile, the agricultural sector newspaper Maaseuduntulevaisuus carries  the results of a poll  asking Finnish voters if they would want EU defense cooperation to move towards creating a common EU army. \n Of those surveyed, 26 percent were in favour of such a plan, 40 percent opposed, and 34 percent undecided. \n When the question was put to 159 of the candidates in the EU Parliament elections, 84 percent were against the idea of working towards creating an EU army. \n DUI sentences vary \n The tabloid  Iltalehti  reports that the penalty for drinking and driving in eastern and northern regions is less severe than in other parts of Finland. \n The paper quotes a University of Helsinki study showing that nationally, on average, the penalty for first-time DUI is a six-month driving licence suspension and a fine equal to 50 days income for the offender. In cases of aggravated DUI when a driver is found to have a blood alcohol content of at least 0.12 percent, or 0.53 milligrammes in a breathalyser test, the median driving ban is 286 days. \n The lightest sentences, the study found, are handed down by courts in the north and east of the country. Younger offenders also tend to get off with lighter sentences. \n Under new legislation coming into force at the beginning of June, DUI cases will not go to court unless appealed. Police will determine the period for a licence suspension, and prosecutors will set fines in each case. \n Pollen season \n Tampere’s Aamulehti shows readers  a photo of a city beach  on Lake Kaukajärvi with the sand and shore-side waters hidden by a thick carpet of yellow pollen. \n Luckily for pollen sufferers, this is spruce pollen which rarely causes allergic symptoms. \n However, the paper reports that birch pollen, which does bother many people, is still  at fairly high levels  in central and northern parts of the country. In southern regions, the amount of pollen from grasses in the air is expected to start rising this week."}
{"text": "A voter survey commissioned by the daily  Helsingin Sanomat  projects a win for the centre-right National Coalition Party (NCP) in Sunday's vote for the EU Parliament, followed by the populist Finns Party and the Social Democratic Party. \n Compared to results in the 2014 vote, the Greens are projected to make the most gains, however, with losses for the Centre Party. Support is also up from five years ago for the Finns Party and the SDP. \n Of the just over 2,000 voters polled May 6-18 in mainland Finland, 16.3 percent gave their backing to the Finns Party. If this actually translates into votes, the Finns Party will narrowly miss getting a third MEP elected. It would, though, have a representative waiting in the wings to take a seat if and when the UK withdraws from the European Union. \n At 20.1 percent, the NCP has a comfortable lead in the poll, but possibly its worst showing ever in EU Parliament elections. Traditionally, the NCP has been more popular with voters in these elections than in national elections. \n Devil in the details \n Most papers, including Tampere's  Aamulehti , report that  five-party talks aimed at forming a new government  here in Finland hit a bump on Monday over objections by the Left Alliance to selling off state-owned property to finance major transport infrastructure projects. \n That party's chair  Li Andersson  called a time-out Monday morning. Leaders in the talks declined to brief the media on the situation, leading to speculation that the talks had run aground. By early afternoon, all the parties were back at the table. \n Although the general framework for economic development seems to have been settled, Andersson did say that there are still more issues to be ironed out than appeared to be last week. \n As Aamulehti points out, Centre Party chair  Juha Sipilä  has backed the establishment of a state-financed project company to create high-speed rail services between Helsinki and Tampere, Helsinki and Turku, and from eastern Finland to the capital. \n One of the redline issues in government formation talks for the Centre Party is its demand for a balanced state budget by 2023. \n Schengen still ok, sort of \n The Kuopio-based  Savon Sanomat  carries a denial by Finns Party leader  Jussi Halla-aho  that his party is pushing for Finland to pull out of the open-border Schengen Area. \n Drawing on a dispatch by the STT Finnish News Agency, the paper reports that the Finns Party does want to change Schengen rules to make it easier for member states to impose border checks. Preventing illegal immigration, said Halla-aho, should be a valid reason to check passports at borders within the Schengen zone. \n At present, Schengen Area regulations allow for  temporary border checks under special circumstances . Both Denmark and Sweden imposed border controls in 2015, citing a massive influx of refugees. \n Halla-aho's remarks came after one of his party's EU Parliament election candidates,  Olli Kotro , gave an interview to the Kremlin-oriented Eurasia Daily saying that he supports Finland's exit from the Schengen Area, and described it as his party's position. \n Kotro also called for special visa arrangements between Finland and Russia. \n According to Savon Sanomat's article, Jussi Halla-aho stated that the Finns Party has had a consistent, negative stance on the issue of a visa-free arrangement between Finland and Russia. \n Red tape over pink house \n The tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  is one of the papers that reports on a case of bureaucracy run wild in the small municipality of Vesilahti, about 30km south of Tampere, where homeowner  Katri Hakola  is facing a 5,000-euro fine for the offence of painting her house pale pink. \n Hakola bought her small wooden house in Vesilahti five years ago. Built in 1949, the house was in disrepair, and she decided to replace the siding and paint it. She filed notice of the renovations with the municipality and got to work. \n The house was already half painted when she received a notice that the colour she had chosen, pink, is not an approved colour in the building code for the type of house Hakola owns. \n She went ahead and finished it anyway, and filed for a permit to keep it that way. Her request was denied. \n Hakola says she's been told that her house \"visibly stands out from its surroundings and attracts attention\", in a \"scenically sensitive area\". \n Now, following a three-year battle, the local board of construction and environment has threatened her with a 5,000-euro fine if she doesn't repaint in a colour it approves. Hakola says she is planning an appeal, pointing out that official colour preferences are a guideline, not a law. \n The affair, which has gained wide-spread attention on social media, is becoming quite an embarrassment for local officials, says Ilta-Sanomat. \n Municipal director  Tuomas Hirvonen  made a surprise visit to the pink house over the weekend to talk with Hakola. He told the paper that while his visit did not mean that officials have changed their decision, progress is being made and a \"certain process\" has been set in motion."}

The accolade includes a prize of 110,000 euros and awarded by Finnish Parliament. Deputy Speaker of Parliament  Paula Risikko  presented the award to Jantunen on Wednesday. \n Jantunen's work is groundbreaking and said to be the first in the world to introduce the production of electroceramics at lower temperatures than was previously possible. Electroceramics are commonly used in products like conductors, inductors, resistors, capacitors and other applications. \n However, until recently the production of electroceramics has required excessive amounts of heat to be integrated with electronic components. The method devised by Jantunen and her team enabled the production of electroceramics to be carried out at significantly lower temperatures. \n Method already in use \n The award process is handled by  Technology Academy Finland  (TAF), while parliament's chancellery commission selects the winner from the group of candidates. \n \"The use of Jantunen's method can reduce energy requirements to 15–30% of the amounts previously needed, which cuts the costs associated with production equipment - easing the process while also being more eco-friendly,\" TAF said in a press release. \n \"The production method has already been used successfully in making products like ceramic antennas.\" \n The group said Jantunen's method now makes it possible to produce small-scale, local and energy-efficient electroceramics which will lead to new material and technological possibilities. \n The award also commemorates the anniversary of universal suffrage on 1 June. The Innovation Award for Women was previously handed out in 2017 and 2018."}
{"text": "As voters in Finland prepare to head to the polls for the European election on Sunday, the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) look set to retain their three MEP seats, according to Yle’s latest measure of voter sentiment. \n The NCP, led by outgoing finance minister  Petteri Orpo , have a proven track record in European elections and have been Finland’s biggest party in the European Parliament since 1999. \n Hot on their heels however are the Greens Party, helped by a 7.9 percent surge in support since the previous European elections in 2014; and the Finns Party, who are predicted to grow their share of the European vote by 4 percent. \n Sipilä's problems persist  \n According to the survey, the biggest loser in the European elections will be the Centre Party, with an almost seven percentage point dip in support compared to the 2014 European elections. The party's struggles have not been helped by the loss of big name candidates such as  Olli Rehn ,  Paavo Väyrynen  and  Anneli Jäätteenmäki , all former MEPs. \n Such an outcome would see the party’s representation at the European Parliament shrink from three members to two, and would be another huge blow to outgoing PM  Juha Sipilä ’s party after a  poor showing at the recent Finnish parliamentary elections . \n Juha Sipilä and his Centre party face a tough EU election Markku Ulander / Lehtikuva \n The poll predicts that the Centre party's lost seat will most likely be picked up by the resurgent Greens, led by former EU special representative and two-time Finnish presidential candidate  Pekka Haavisto . \n The other parties currently with representatives in the European Parliament - the Social Democrat Party (2), the Swedish People's Party (1) and the Left Alliance (1) - are all expected to retain their seats. \n Low turnout \n The results will, however, depend heavily on voter turnout, which tends to be significantly lower for European elections than for Finnish parliamentary elections. This makes accurate estimations particularly difficult, according to  Tuomo Turja , Research Director at pollster Taloustutkimus. \n \"These are elections in which a large majority of voters usually abstain,\" Turja says. \n At the last EU elections in 2014, voter turnout in Finland was just 39 percent, compared with a figure of 70 percent for the national elections held in 2015. Parliamentary elections held earlier this year saw 73 percent of eligible Finns make their way to polling stations, but it remains to be seen if this momentum will carry on into the EU elections. \n There are early signs of voter turnout being higher for this election, with an  increase in advance voting from the figures for 2014 .  Yle News also found voter appetite to be strong  when we took to the streets of Helsinki recently to gauge public opinion ahead of Sunday's election."}
{"text": "The nationalist Finns Party youth organisation has deleted a racist tweet posted on its Twitter account, calling it \"ill-advised\". \n \"My tweet was thoughtless and I acted impulsively when the idea struck me. I later realised that it was misguided, but the damage was already done. I have learnt my lesson and moving forward, I will use better judgement when it comes to the organisation’s communications,” deputy chair  Toni Jalonen  said in a statement released on the Finns Party Youth website on Thursday. The statement did not include any specific apology. \n The populist party's youth group had posted an image of a dark-skinned couple holding a baby, with text urging people to vote for the Finns Party \"if you don’t want Finland’s future to look like this\". The photo was copied from a Facebook post by the European Parliament. \n Veiled criticism from party chair \n While the Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  did not explicitly comment on the since-deleted tweet, he wrote in a Facebook post that the party's goals do not include scrutinising the genetic heritage of humans or defining and limiting Finnishness. \n “Unfortunately, there is a small group of people in the youth organisation who do not seem to understand and accept the party's line and whose activities focus on harming the party and its youth organisation — for example, by attacking the party's own candidates.”  Halla-aho  wrote. \n Prosecutor General  Raija Toiviainen  also took a general stand on the issue by saying that in such cases, the first thing to be clarified is the motive. Toiviainen, who was on a business trip abroad, admitted she had not seen the tweet herself and could not follow the discussion around it. She said that when a message has a racist motive — that is, if the publisher of this message wanted to say that dark-skinned people do not belong to Finland and are somehow inferior — it is punishable by law. \n String of hate speech convictions \n Since the Finns Party was established in 1995,  a number of its politicians , including immigration hardliner Halla-aho, have been  convicted of online hate speech . The party split in 2017  when Halla-aho was elected chair , with co-founder  Timo Soini  and other more moderate party leaders leaving to form an ill-fated new party. \n Halla-aho's Finns Party came close to winning April's parliamentary election, earning just one seat fewer in the new parliament than the Social Democrats, who are now trying to form a government without them. That would leave Halla-aho as opposition leader. \n Several opinion polls after the election suggested that the Finns Party was the country's most popular, although  an Yle survey published on Thursday  showed slipping narrowly into third place."}

The party ended the night with 16 percent of votes and picked up an additional 6.7 percent of ballots and another seat to send two MEPs to Brussels. \n It was the party’s best-ever Europarliament election result, eclipsing any outcome it had seen in parliamentary elections. \n \"The Greens are now among the big parties,\" party chair  Pekka Haavisto  said as he reacted to the results. \n The Greens may have been the evening’s biggest winner, but the National Coalition Party led by  Petteri Orpo  topped the poll with 20.8 percent voter support to retain its three MEP seats, although voter enthusiasm in this election slipped by 1.8 percentage points. Earlier in the evening, Orpo reacted to advance voting results that showed his party at the top of the table. \n \"This does look like an election win. It’s a very strong first place. Taking the parliamentary election result into consideration, you have to be satisfied.\" \n The Social Democratic Party also protected its two Europarliament seats, snapping up an additional 2.3 percent of votes in this election to close the night on 14.6 percent support. Earlier in the evening party chair  Antti Rinne  had characterised the advance voting result that put it in second place as an \"election win\". \n Centre trounced in second consecutive poll \n Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party was once more repudiated by voters as the party haemorrhaged 6.1 percent of votes to lose one seat in the European Parliament. This means it will be represented by two MEPs in the next session. Sipilä had already departed the election watch and left vice chair  Katri Kulumni  to field questions about the party’s performance. \n \"It is a sad ending to the [political] career of Juha Sipilä, whose star seemed so bright just a few years ago,\" Helsinki University world politics professor  Teivo Teivainen  remarked to Yle News as he harked back to the Centre’s  ignominious defeat in parliamentary elections  just about one month ago. \n The Finns Party, which was widely expected to dumbfound critics as it did during the parliamentary elections, picked up an additional one percent of votes and held on to its two MEP seats. However the result appeared to fall short of  the populist wave that political pundits anticipated  across the continent. \n \"It looks like political parties were better able to mobilise voters who were concerned about issues like climate change and social exclusion and equality than the far-right was able to mobilise about closing borders,\" social commentator and writer  Maryan Abdulkarim  told Yle News. She noted that Green parties had posted big gains across the EU on election night. \n The Swedish People’s Party and the Left Alliance both kept their single MEP seats safe in this election, although the Left saw 2.4 percent of voters abandon it compared to a negligible 0.4 percent for the SPP. The parties closed off the evening with 6.4 and 6.9 percent voter support respectively. \n SDP's Heinäluoma the biggest vote magnet \n Candidates who secured Europarliament sets on Sunday included familiar names such as the Greens’  Heidi Hautala  and  Ville Niinistö , as well as  Laura Huhtasaari  and  Teuvo Hakkarainen  of the Finns Party in addition to the Centre’s  Mauri Pekkarinen ,  Henna Virkkunen  of the NCP and  Nils Torvalds  of the SPP. \n The SDP’s  Eero Heinäluoma  was the evening’s biggest vote magnet, with Ville Niinistö also proving to be a popular candidate, as well as Huhtasaari. \n Election officials’ initial estimate is that 42.7 percent of eligible voters turned out to cast their ballots in this year’s election, compared to five years ago, when the voter turnout was 39.1 percent. Based on the initial results, the average age of Finnish MEPs is 55 with not a single MEP under the age of 40 elected. \n Finland will seat 13 Europarliamentarians in Brussels, but if and when the UK exits the EU, a 14th member will be elevated. Based on the results so far, Christian Democratic Party chair  Sari Essayah  could nab the seat, however Yle’s forecast gives the position to the NCP’s  Eija-Riitta Korhola ."}

Rinne said the boost in spending will be bankrolled by employment measures, tax elements and reappropriations as well as selling off state ownership. \n Rinne predicted that as long as growth conditions remain normal, the state will not take on extra debt and employment will reach 75 percent during the next four-year legislative term. \n According to Statistics Finland, that rate stood at 71.2 percent in April. \n As Kuoppamäki sees it, these latest figures throw cold water on Rinne's predictions. \n \"GDP growth is clearly below the level that was expected,\" he said. \n In an economic forecast last month, the Finance Ministry predicted that private consumption would continue to grow strongly this year, a prospect that now looks unlikely. \n \"This underlines the fact that the government negotiations must bolster private consumption,\" Kuoppamäki said. \n Rinne was expected to announce the status – and possible conclusion – of government formation talks on Wednesday afternoon."}

{"text": "Several domestic dailies on Friday reported on a grisly find in the Spanish city of Mijas on the Costa del Sol. Locals discovered the dead bodies of a Finnish man and woman in an apartment,  Spanish sources  said. \n Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat quote Spanish papers, which indicated   that neighbours contacted police over a bad smell emanating from the apartment in the Las Lagunas area. Emergency services found the bodies of a 26-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man on arrival. \n One local paper wrote  that a preliminary medical examiner's report suggested drugs may be involved in the deaths. Blood was also found in the apartment hallway, IS reported. \n The relationship between the two deceased people and the Spanish apartment's Finnish owner is not yet clear. \n IS said that autopsies will be performed on the bodies on Friday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told IS early on Friday that they had not yet received word of the deaths. \n Minister: \"Fund education, not free books\" \n The next government, still forming under the leadership of Social Democrat chair  Antti Rinne , vowed on Thursday that compulsory schooling in future would extend from primary education (grades 1-9) through to upper secondary education or vocational school. MPs from the National Coalition Party (NCP), which appears to be heading to the opposition opposed the plan, with caretaker Education Minister  Sanni Grahn-Laasonen  tweeting her criticism of the proposal,  according to Tampere-based daily Aamulehti . \n \"It would be more effective to increase support and strengthen daycare and primary education. Fix the foundation first! Fund education, not free books,\" Grahn-Laasonen tweeted. \n The minister was referring to the required reading and studying materials for upper secondary education, which are known to be  costly for students and their families . Rinne's SDP, the Left Alliance and the Greens all campaigned on a platform of making upper secondary education free, including text books and other learning materials, the paper noted. \n Another NCP MP,  Timo Heinonen  took to Twitter to say that extending compulsory basic education to around the age of 20 \"would not be easy\". \n AL noted that the outgoing government headed by  Juha Sipilä  slashed Finland's education budget by some 690 million euros, nixing about 250 million from upper secondary education. \n Struggling farms going under \n Iltalehti reported Friday  that many Finnish farms are declaring bankruptcy, according to regional paper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus, as dairy entrepreneurs who invested in their farms in previous years when the price of milk was high are now facing dire straits and having to shutter their gates, in turn pushing cattle-breeders to the brink of their financial resources. \n Agriculture expert  Osmo Autio  from financial firm Wikli Group told IL that he has had to file about one bankruptcy notice per week for failing farms – and that the worst may be to come. \n \"Our company's backlog is about 12-13 cases long at the moment, all of them going under. Bankruptcy will be declared by the taxman, creditors or the entrepreneurs themselves,\" Autio said. \n Autio emphasised that the farms facing closure are not small or badly run businesses; some of the dairy farms seeking financial guidance produce an average yield of more than 10,000 kg of milk products a year. \n IL also wrote that fur farms are in for grim prospects in the future as well, as fur operations are often a side business for farmers. \n Yle News has  reported  on the  woes  of  farmers  for  many years . The price paid to Finnish farmers for raw milk  fell by 12.5 percent  in 2015, a dip caused in part by Russian sanctions on EU products and a fall in consumer spending power."}

At the time the former business leader was seen as a breath of fresh air who would bring the efficiency of private enterprise to the public sector. \n Shortest term affected by illness \n A series of eye-watering  spending cuts  and unpopular  labour market reforms  soon drew widespread condemnation and voters repudiated the Centre in both parliamentary and  Europarliament elections  this year, making Sipilä a one-term premier. \n Just weeks prior to the general election, Sipilä tendered  his government’s resignation  on 8 May, after failing to push through the administration’s flagship reform to social and health care services. \n Finland’s shortest-lived administration lasted from 8 August 1944 to 21 September 1944 and was led by National Coalition Party politician Anders Verner Hackzell. He was chosen to form a government of public servants and other officials with the aim of signing a peace treaty with the then-Soviet Union, however he never completed the negotiations due to illness. \n The first government in Finland to exceed 1,000 days was that of Toivo Mikael Kivimäki of the National Progressive Party, which held office from 14 December 1932 to 7 October 1936, a total of 1,394 days. \n See the full listing of  Finnish governments and their terms in office here ."}
{"text": "A citizens' initiative on creating a law to specifically ban the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Finland is headed to the new Parliament for consideration by MPs. The initiative garnered a total of 61,266 signatures by the beginning of last October, but already reached the required  50,000 signature mark  a few months earlier. \n The document will be handed to MPs by humanitarian advocacy group World Vision Finland'sprogramme director  Annette Gothóni  and expert advisor  Ujuni Ahmed , as well as the managing director of fashion textile firm Finlayson,  Jukka Kurttila . \n According to Finnish law, the act of genital mutilation is already considered to be aggravated assault. But Gothóni said a more specific law should be created. \n \"A separate law [on banning FGM] would be important for preventative work and changing the attitudes of parents [who might be considering carrying it out on their girls]. If the practice was specifically forbidden by law, it would be easier for various authorities to discuss the matter [with parents] before it happens,\" Gothóni said. \n \"The problem is that parents who cut their girls do not consider the mutilation to be assault. The current legislation is inadequate. A separate law is needed to protect girls,\" Ahmed added. \n FGM still common \n An estimated 200 million girls and women around the world have undergone FGM, with more than three million girls facing the practice every year, according to the  World Health Organisation . \n Late last year, the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) estimated as many as 3,000 girls in Finland faced the risk of being subjected to FGM. The public health watchdog estimated  more than 10,000 girls and women  resident in Finland have already undergone the procedure. \n Even before receiving the citizens' initiative on the matter,  the incoming government  is reportedly already making plans to ban FGM in new legislation."}
{"text": "SDP chair  Antti Rinne , 56, was sworn in as prime minister on Thursday to lead Finland's 75th government. Rinne, whose Social Democratic Party narrowly won April's election, is a former finance minister and union boss. \n He was approved as the new premier by a vote of 111 to 74 in a Parliamentary session that began around noon, with Rinne serving as interim Speaker of Parliament. Fourteen of the new MPs were absent. \n All the 'no' votes came from the three main opposition parties, with the sole MP from the Liike Nyt (Movement Now) group voting with the five government parties. \n Story continues after photo \n Rinne was elected by a 111-74 vote. Jussi Nukari / Lehtikuva \n After the vote, Rinne and the 18 other cabinet ministers walked to the Presidential Palace to meet with President  Sauli Niinistö . \n At 2pm, the president approved the resignation of outgoing PM and Centre Party chair  Juha Sipilä  and then formally appointed Rinne as the new prime minister. The new ministers were then sworn in, using either Finnish or Swedish and either a Bible or law book, according to their own preferences. \n Earlier on Thursday, Rinne met with Niinistö and was formally appointed to form a new government. \n Story continues after photo \n Rinne met with Niinistö on Thursday morning. Jussi Nukari / Lehtikuva \n On Friday MPs will elect the new Speaker of Parliament and two deputy speakers. The new Speaker is expected to be former Centre PM  Matti Vanhanen , 63. Former minister  Tuula Haatainen  of the SDP is to continue as the first deputy speaker while  Juho Eerola  of the Finns Party will likely become the second deputy speaker. \n Comfortable majority in Parliament \n Rinne aims to lead a five-party centre-left coalition government for the next four years. Besides the SDP and Centre, it includes the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party. \n The cabinet parties have a comfortable 117-seat majority in the 200-seat Parliament. \n However they will likely face pressures from within as well as from the two main opposition parties, the right-leaning Finns Party and National Coalition Party. They each have nearly as many MPs as the SDP, wit the top three parties holding 40, 39 and 38 seats respectively. The nationalist Finns Party, led by immigration hardliner  Jussi Hallo-aho , is just one seat shy of being the largest and has been leading opinion polls since the election. \n One holdover from Sipilä cabinet \n About 58 percent of the ministers in Rinne's cabinet are women. That is up sharply from the previous Sipilä government, but still short of the 60 percent ratio in Vanhanen's 2007-10 cabinet. \n Story continues after photo \n Cabinet ministers walked to the House of the Estates on Helsinki's warmest day of the year so far. Pekka Tynell / Yle \n The new ministers range in age from 31 to 61. The youngest is Minister of Economic Affairs  Katri Kulmuni , a second-term MP and deputy Centre Party chair from Tornio in Finnish Lapland, while the eldest is Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto , an MP, Greens chair and former minister from Helsinki. \n The only minister to carry over from Sipilä's cabinet to Rinne's is Centre Party MP  Annika Saarikko . She moves from being Minister of Family Affairs and Social Service to Minister of Science and Culture, a newly-renamed post that operates under the Ministry of Education. \n Lintilä represents Centre at press conference \n In the late afternoon, the new government held a brief press conference at the House of the Estates, where they had hashed out their agenda over the past month. \n Story continues after photo \n Henriksson, Lintilä, Rinne, Haavisto and Andersson meet the press. Pekka Tynell / Yle \n Four of the five parties were represented by their chairs, while the Centre was represented by Finance Minister  Mika Lintilä .

{"text": "From a total of 19 ministerial portfolios in the new Finnish cabinet, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) will hold seven and the Centre will occupy five. The Greens will hold three while the Left Alliance and Swedish People's Party (SPP) will have two each. The names of the ministers are to be announced later. \n The  incoming government will put an end to eight years of austerity , adding 1.2 billion euros to government expenditure. Spending will be offset by higher tobacco, alcohol and fuel taxes. \n The Social Democrats, with  their razor-thin victory  in April’s general election, had their first pick of ministerial portfolios, naturally taking over the premiership and gaining seven portfolios, including those for European Affairs, Local Government and state ownership steering, Development and Foreign Trade, Family Affairs and Social Services, Transport as well as Labour. \n The Centre Party, which is stepping down as the prime minister’s party following a  crushing defeat in the election , will take over five portfolios: Finance, Economy, Defense, Agriculture and a new combined Science and Culture portfolio, under the Education Ministry. \n Juha Sipilä , premier of the outgoing centre-right government, said he’d be following the new government's employment targets from the back benches. He explained later that he will not be a minister before leaving his post as party chair in September. \n SPP chair  Anna-Maja Henriksson  said she didn’t see any obstacles to Finland  reaching its goal of 75-percent employment  as it has been achievable in the other Nordic countries. \n Finland’s next foreign minister will be from the Greens. The party, which saw it's  best ever EU election resul t in last month's Europarliament elections, will also run the Environment and Interior ministries. \n Green Party chair  Pekka Haavisto  called the environmental agenda the \"most ambitious climate plan globally,\" aiming for carbon neutrality by 2035, though the government did not provide concrete plans at its press conference at Helsinki's central library Oodi on Monday. Ahead of government formation talks, Rinne said all parties forming the new government must commit to keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, in line with recommendations from the  UN climate group IPCC . \n The Left Alliance will oversee the ministries of Education and Social Affairs and Health, which could signal a turnaround in recent efforts to  open the Finnish healthcare sector  to private providers.  Li Andersson , Left Alliance chair, said Finland would roll back a  contentious 'activation model'  and make upper secondary school materials free for students. The new administration wants to  extend compulsory education to include upper secondary and vocational schooling . \n The Swedish People’s Party will hold on to the Justice Ministry while also picking up the equality minister's post. \n Referring to the five-group coalition and her childhood memories of libraries, Henriksson quipped, “everything usually ends well for the Famous Five, and that’s what happened here,” she said referring to children’s adventure novel series from the 1940s and '50s."}
{"text": "Speaking at Helsinki's main library on Monday morning, Prime Minister-designate  Antti Rinne  announced that his new  government will include 19 ministers  from five parties – but did not reveal the names of the new cabinet members. They will likely be confirmed by the parties on Tuesday. \n The ministers will most likely include the party chairs who flanked Rinne at the event, except for outgoing PM  Juha Sipilä , whose Centre Party is continuing in government despite suffering dramatic defeats in April's parliamentary election. After that, Sipilä announced that he would step down when the party elects a new leader at an extraordinary conference in September. \n \"I led my own party to a major electoral defeat, so I am not available for a position of responsibility, not as a minister or speaker of Parliament. This is my way of taking responsibility in this situation,\" Sipilä said on Monday. The Centre has been handed five portfolios: Finance, Economy, Defense, Agriculture and a new combined Science and Culture portfolio, under the Education Ministry. \n SDP deputy chair  Sanna Marin , who led the party through much of last winter's election campaign  while Rinne was on sick leave , is on the other hand widely expected to hold a cabinet seat. The SDP will hold seven portfolios, including Labour, European Affairs, Local Government and state ownership steering, Transport, Development and Foreign Trade, Family Affairs and Social Services. \n SPP in justice, equality and Nordic posts \n After the event,  Swedish People's Party (SPP) chair   Anna-Maja Henriksson  said that MP  Thomas Blomqvist   from Raseborg , western Uusimaa, will be minister of equality and Nordic cooperation. Yle has learned that Henriksson will resume her old post of justice minister, which she held in two cabinets between 2011 and 2015. \n Left Alliance chair  Li Andersson , the youngest of the five government party chairs at 32, told Yle that she is interested in the position of education minister. Like the SPP, her party has been allocated two seats in the cabinet. Besides education, it will oversee social affairs and health. \n Greens take foreign affairs, environment and climate portfolios \n Greens chair  Pekka Haavisto , a former environment minister and UN official, is widely expected to become the new foreign minister. That role will be key as Finland takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union on 1 July. His party will hold three seats in the new cabinet, with one likely to be the renamed post of Minister for the Environment and Climate. \n According to the daily Helsingin Sanomat, former Greens MP  Oras Tynkkynen  hopes to take that post, despite losing his seat in Parliament in April, only earning a spot as a substitute. Tynkkynen, a former leader of the Greens parliamentary delegation, was Advisor on Climate Policy to former Centre Party PM  Matti Vanhanen . He is now a  senior advisor on the carbon-neutral circular economy  at the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra and a Tampere city councillor. Finnish government ministers are usually – but not necessarily – members of parliament. \n The Greens are to chose their ministers on Tuesday. MP  Maria Ohisalo ,  the only candidate to take over from Haavisto  as party chair later this month, is also expected to take on a cabinet post. The Greens' third seat will be Minister of the Interior."}
{"text": "Tuesday's papers lead with stories reviewing the new five-party coalition's proposed programme and goals, which include making the country carbon-neutral by 2035 and significantly increasing spending by 1.2 billion euros. \n Finnish daily  Helsingin Sanomat (HS)  runs several articles looking at what’s in store, including a two-page spread entitled \"Will the parties keep their promises?\" \n The daily examines both pre-election promises and what was unveiled on  Monday at Helsinki's main library Oodi  where Prime Minister-designate  Antti Rinne  (SDP) and coalition party chairs  Pekka Haavisto  (Greens),  Juha Sipilä  (Centre),  Li Andersson  (Left) and  Anna-Maja Henriksson  (SPP) revealed the draft agenda. \n Promises, promises \n According to HS, one of the details that has been much mulled over by the press is Rinne’s pre-election vow on May Day 2018. \"I promise an additional 100 euros a month to those who receive a pension that's less than 1,400 euros a month.\" \n HS writes about the new government's proposal to increase the pension of those who receive less than 1,000 euros a month by 50 euros. \n \"Fifty euros isn’t 100 euros,\" writes HS, but goes on to point out that, \"Rinne didn’t promise 100 euros in the first year, he often (went on to) emphasise that the top-up would be made according to what the budget would allow.\" \n \"Too good to be true\" \n HS also ran a straw poll of people on the street about the incoming government's plans. \n \"In theory the new government budget sounds very good. But we’ll still have to wait and see where all the money comes from and how realistic the programme really is at the end of the day,\"  Ella Salminen , a 24-year-old student, told HS. \n Meanwhile,  Toivo Koivisto , 74, told the paper that presenting the new government plan in a library \"was an awesome spectacle\" but that \"the first thought that came to mind was that this is too good to be true.\" \n Effects of the sin tax \n Tampere-based daily  Aamulehti   also explored the proposed plan at length, including a concrete list of what will change if it takes effect. \n Examples of the so-called sin tax will most affect those with unhealthy habits. For example, according to Aamulehti, the increased cost of a packet of cigarettes by 1.8 euros would increase the annual sum for pack-a-day smokers by 657 euros. \n Other examples include the increased cost of sugary soft drinks – a 1.5-litre bottle would go up by 10 cents increasing the annual cost for 1.5 litre-a-day soda drinkers by 36.50 euros a year. \n Meanwhile, added taxes on a bottle of wine ( .75 litre) would increase the cost by a total of 10.92 euros per year, based on consumption of a bottle of wine per week. \n Far north cabinet hopefuls \n And at the top of Finland, the main daily of Finnish Lapland,  Lapin Kansa , leads with a story speculating whether Lapland will get its own minister in the new cabinet with the region’s  Markus Lohi  and  Katri Kulmuni   of the Centre Party as the strongest candidates. \n HS, Aamulehti and Lapin Kansa also carried news of the five-party leaders' choice of the nickname \"the Famous Five\", which brings to mind British writer  Enid Blyton ’s popular children’s book series of the same name. \n Many papers speculate on whether all of the Famous Five’s ambitious plans will be realised. Avid readers may recall that the Famous Five’s adventures all took place while the kids were on holiday."}
{"text": "A past conviction for assault and sexual harassment against  freshly-minted Finns Party MEP   Teuvo Hakkarainen  has become enforceable, the Helsinki Court of Appeal ruled on Tuesday. \n This means that Hakkarainen will have to pay the 80-day fine for the offences, which were committed in December 2017. \n A lower court  had convicted the then-Finns Party MP  and sentenced him to a 45-day fine for assault and sexual harassment of National Coalition Party MP  Veera Ruoho. \n However, the appeal court stiffened the sentence to an 80-day fine, which based on Hakkarainen’s income at the time, amounted to 5,440 euros. The lower court had also ordered the former sawmill owner to pay Ruoho an additional 1,400 euros in damages. \n During the district court trial, prosecutor  Eija Velitski  had called on the court to hand down a two-month suspended sentence. However she said last spring that she would not appeal the appellate court’s ruling. \n Ruoho is a former Finns Party MP who quit the nationalist party when immigration hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho  became chair in June 2017. \n Hakkarainen has a record of seven convictions since 1985, including chopping down trees illegally while drunk, stealing silverware and wine from a church, drunk driving, speeding, and  ethnic agitation  for anti-Muslim comments on Facebook in 2016."}

The previous government will officially resign at this time. \n A subsequent constitutive session will see the ministers take an oath of office, divvy up responsibilities, and formally submit their Government Programme to Parliament. This session will be followed by the new government paying a complimentary visit to the Presidential Palace, on the heels of a similar 'farewell' visit from the outgoing administration. \n The paper writes that Parliament will select a new Speaker on Friday and begin discussion of the incoming government's programme next Tuesday. \n 11 women ministers, 8 men \n Capital city area daily Helsingin Sanomat features a story on the  gender balance of the new government , as women account for 11 of the incoming cabinet's ministers, while eight are men. \n HS says this is still not the most female-heavy government in Finnish history, as the second 2007-2010 coalition fronted by Centre Party PM  Matti Vanhanen  still holds the record for the largest percentage of women, with 12 female ministers out of 20. \n In contrast, five of Juha Sipilä's outgoing 16 ministers were women, and of the 23 various ministers that shuffled through his administration over the past four years, only nine were female. \n Fortifying the welfare state \n HS's political analyst  Marko Junkkari  writes in a  column  today that the incoming PM  Antti Rinne  repeatedly mentioned the welfare state in his government's programme, saying several times that his new left-leaning coalition will work to \"strengthen\" it. \n Junkkari points out the contrast to outgoing PM Juha Sipilä's coalition, which made no mention of Finland's  hyvinvointivaltio  in its government programme – the first coalition to not do so since the 1950s. \n The paper's analyst says the Finnish public is traditionally very supportive of the welfare state, with polls consistently indicating that residents are willing to pay considerable taxes to keep the social system in motion. \"I dare say it's doubtful there will be any downsizing over the next four years,\" he says. \n Payback time \n And the tabloid Iltalehti wraps up this Thursday's paper review with news of an audit at the state benefits administrator Kela which found more than  800 individuals had received unemployment benefits under false pretences . \n Kela said in a statement that it regularly checks the income of people receiving the different kinds of  unemployment benefits  that are available in Finland, and their latest appraisal examined income from earnings and other sources during 2016. The agency's website says that the relevant data from 1,167 unemployment benefit recipients were analysed, and the income from 812 indicated that their benefits had been granted based on faulty information. \n Most of the cases involved salaries or wages that the beneficiary had not reported to Kela, although there were also a few cases of unreported earnings from business activities and copyright payments. \n The agency says it will be asking recipients to pay back the excess – an average of close to 7,000 euros for the year per person, accounting for a total of nearly five million euros. In 2016, Kela distributed over two billion euros in unemployment benefits to approximately 388,000 people."}
{"text": "Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne  has blossomed into what appears to be an expert negotiator who led disciplined and smooth talks to form Finland's new five-party coalition, according to political commentator  Sini Korpinen  and world politics professor  Teivo Teivainen . \n Dubbed the \"Famous Five\" by Swedish People's Party  Anna-Maja Henriksson,  the new cabinet was  sworn into office  by President  Sauli Niinistö  on Thursday afternoon, bringing an end to weeks of discussions involving Rinne's SDP, the Centre Party led by former PM  Juha Sipilä ,  Pekka Haavisto 's Green Party, the Left Alliance led by  Li Andersson , and the SPP. \n Following a  parliamentary election in April , Korpinen had tapped  Petteri Orpo' s National Coalition Party to join a Rinne-led administration. However Teivainen observed that the parties proved to be too far apart on key issues to allow them to cooperate in government. \n Korpinen noted that while the Centre Party may have had to concede ground on some issues, it did emerge a winner as it is still in government and was also able to push through its goal of creating 18 regional administrations to deliver social and health care services as part of  an ambitious reform package . \n Boost for Haavisto's possible presidential aspirations \n With Rinne as premier, the Centre's  Mika Lintilä , a former economic affairs minister, will assume the finance minister portfolio, while the Greens' Haavisto will be foreign minister. Teivainen noted that Haavisto will be surfing the Green wave that characterised the Finnish general election as well as  recent European Parliament elections . Finnish foreign policy will more closely resemble EU foreign policy, particularly on climate issues, he added. \n According to Teivainen, as a skilled and well-respected international negotiator, Haavisto's foreign minister portfolio could well help set up another presidential election bid for the Greens chair. \n With the Finns Party now the largest party in opposition, Teivainen said voters can expect to see chair  Jussi Halla-aho  adopt an even tougher stance on immigration as well as on social welfare issues. Korpinen said that if the NCP, which is now also occupying opposition benches, finds common ground with the Finns Party, it could drive more liberal NCP voters toward the Greens. \n APN returns in autumn \n All Points North will take a break for the summer.

{"text": "Yle’s latest political barometer, which comes on the heels of  the swearing in of a new government  led by Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne , shows little change from a previous post-election poll. The new PM’s party enjoys the support of 17.4 percent of the electorate, down by a negligible 0.4 percentage points from a previous poll. All of the changes in the new survey were well within the two-percent-point margin of error. \n The new voter approval survey shows the outgoing PM  Juha Sipilä ’s Centre Party with greatest movement of all of the major political parties – albeit downward by 0.9 percentage points – settling at 12.4 percent backing and continuing a months-long slippage. \n On the other end of the spectrum, the nationalist Finns Party posted the biggest gains, with support rising 0.7 percentage points to 19.5 percent. It is now Finland’s most popular political party with a lead of more than two percentage points over the second place SDP. \n \"New Finns Party supporters have woken up this time around, meaning that they didn’t vote in the elections. But if we consider this party, it is mainly stripping backing from the Centre Party,\" Taloustutkimus research director  Jari Pajunen  said. \n Greens see spike in ex-chair's hometown, Turku \n Meanwhile Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto ’s Green Party overtook the Centre to occupy fourth place in the poll with 13.9 percent backing. Former Greens chair  Ville Niinistö ’s successful run for an MEP seat was reflected in the poll results, which showed strong spike in support for the party in Niinistö’s hometown, Turku, Pajunen noted. \n Taloustutkimus gathered responses for the survey during government formation talks involving the SDP, Centre, Greens, Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party, with the last of the responses recorded on Tuesday. \n This means that the poll does not reflect possible reaction to  the government agenda , which was formally announced on Monday. All the same, the new government coalition enjoys a combined level of support of 56 percent of voters. \n Now in opposition, the National Coalition Party led by former finance minister  Petteri Orpo  holds third place in the survey with 16.7 percent voter approval. Relegation to the opposition benches does not appear to have boosted the party’s popularity, but may have been a disappointment to supporters, the pollster speculated. \n Similarly, the Left Alliance did not appear to benefit from its participation in coalition formation talks as just eight percent of voters backed it. Voter enthusiasm for the party now stands at 7.8 percent, making it the first time since last summer that backing has fallen below eight percent. \n Voters bolder about declaring support \n However, another junior government party, the Swedish People's Party, did enjoy a slight, 0.5-percentage-point bump in voter support to arrive at 4.5 percent voter approval. \n Backing for the Christian Democrats remained almost steady at 3.6 percent, while the one-MP party Movement Now registered 1.7 percent voter support. \n The Blue Reform, which splintered from the Finns Party in 2017, did not see any MPs re-elected to parliament, so it does not appear in the poll. \n As was the case one month ago, a larger than usual proportion of respondents – more than 76 percent compared to the usual 60-odd percent – were prepared to disclose their party affiliations. \n According to Taloustutkimus voters’ readiness to declare their intentions increased during the April parliamentary election and the European Parliament election that took place in May."}
{"text": "Parliament convened on Friday to elect a speaker and deputy speakers for the new four-year parliamentary term, choosing MPs from the Centre, SDP and Finns Parties for the roles. \n Matti Vanhanen of the Centre took the top job, with SDP MP  Tuula Haatainen  and Finns Party legislator  Juha Eerola  chosen as deputies. \n The National Coalition Party (NCP) protested at being left outside the speakership by abstaining from the confirmatory vote. By convention the speaker comes from the second-largest party, with his or her deputies providing a balance. \n In the last parliamentary term however, all three spots went to government parties--which were also the three largest parties in parliament. \n This time round the Finns Party had demanded that the speakership be a Finns Party MP, as they are the second largest group of MPs in parliament. \n Discussion culture \n In his acceptance speech Vanhanen touched on the more direct style of political debate that has emerged in recent years. \n “Our century-old form of government is currently producing some creative tension between the government and parliament,” said the 63-year-old. “Let’s use that for the common good. As speaker I will work to advance a culture of debate in which differences of opinion are not hidden, but we value others’ motives and avoid deliberate misunderstandings.” \n He also expressed the hope that MPs would reform the workings of committees in parliament. \n In her speech, Haatainen said that she hoped parliament would provide a good example of a culture of discussion and debate, and that MPs should respect one another and remember that parliament is a workplace. \n Eerola, on the other hand, said that stressing hate speech had the effect of restricting freedom of speech. \n Vanhanen took 141 votes in the closed ballot, with 39 abstensions. Three candidates got one vote each and two ballot papers were rejected. \n Comeback kid \n A political veteran who was once voted ‘sexiest man in Finland’ by readers of a gossip magazine, Vanhanen was first elected to parliament in 1991 before resigning his seat in 2010 along with the post of Prime Minister after a bruising campaign financing scandal. \n He ran for president in 2018 but didn’t make the second round, polling just 4.1 percent of the vote. \n In other parliamentary business, the Centre Party group elected  Antti Kurvinen  as its leader, replacing  Antti Kaikkonen  who will be Defence Minister in the new government. The Left Alliance chose  Paavo Arhinmäki  to lead its MPs replacing  Aino-Kaisa Pekonen  who has been named as the minister in charge of social affairs and health. \n The Swedish People’s Party’s MPs will be led by  Anders Adlercreutz , while the Finns Party has nominated  Mika Niikko  to lead the Foreign Affairs committee."}
{"text": "The Swedish People's Party has unanimously re-elected  Anna-Maja Henriksson  as its chair. She got the green light for another three-year leadership term at a party conference in Vaasa on Finland's west coast. She had no challenger for the post. \n Last week Henriksson resumed her old post of justice minister, which she held in two cabinets between 2011 and 2015. \n Henriksson said that the results of the two elections this spring showed that the small language-based party remains relevant. \n \"The results of this political spring speak for themselves. There is clearly a demand for our policies. Finland needs the SPP and its liberal, bourgeois policies\". \n Support between 4.5 and 6.3% \n The small, middle-of-the-road Swedish People's Party has just returned to its familiar spot as a junior government partner after a rare term in the opposition. \n An Yle opinion poll released on Friday showed the party gaining a slight rise in popularity up to 4.5 percent voter approval. That is the same level of support it garnered in April's parliamentary election, allowing it retain its nine seats in the 200-seat legislature – and its status as seventh largest of the eight parties in Parliament. \n The SPP performed slightly better in May's European Parliament election, picking up 6.3 percent of voters and holding on to its one seat among a baker's dozen Finnish MEPs. \n According to Statistics Finland, 5.2 percent of the population spoke Swedish as a mother tongue in 2018, down from 6.3 percent in 1980. \n Adlercreutz leads parliamentary delegation \n As the smallest of the five parties in the new coalition government, the SPP has  two cabinet seats  out of 19. The second went to  Thomas Blomqvist  of Raseborg, western Uusimaa, who is now minister for equality and Nordic cooperation. \n Henriksson hails from Jakobstad, 100 km up the coast from Vaasa, where she has been a town councillor since 1997. The 55-year-old lawyer has been in Parliament since 2007, becoming  the SPP's first female chair  in June 2016. \n The party elected three deputy chairs on Sunday:  Sandra Bergqvist ,  Silja Borgarsdóttir Sandelin  and  Henrik Wickström . Former deputy chair  Anders Adlercreutz , an architect from Kirkkonummi, was elected as leader of the SPP parliamentary group, taking over from Blomqvist."}
{"text": "Southwest daily Turun Sanomat  reports  that South Korean President  Moon Jae-in  and his wife  Kim Jung-sook  have arrived in Finland for a state visit. Their trip, which began Sunday, will last through Tuesday. \n Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  and his wife  Jenni Haukio  will greet their guests today at a ceremony at Helsinki's Presidential Palace. The ceremony will begin at 10 am, weather permitting, and the public will be able to follow the proceedings from Helsinki's Market Square. \n Niinistö's office says the presidents will discuss bilateral relations, regional questions and multilateral cooperation on a global level. The leaders will hold a joint press conference once the talks have finished. \n The previous presidential visit from the Republic of Korea took place in 2006. Niinistö last visited South Korea when he attended the international Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul in 2012. \n Who walks the talk? \n Oulu-based newspaper Kaleva features  answers  from some of Finland's new ministers about their lifestyle choices with respect to the government programme's new climate agenda. \n The ministers were asked where they lived, in what kind of home, and how they heated it. They were also asked what kind of transportation they used. Examples include Left Alliance chair and education minister  Li Andersson , whosays she lives in a wooden oil-heated row house in Turku and has an apartment in Helsinki with district heating that she buys from renewable energy sources. She says she primarily uses the train or walks. \n Defence minister  Antti Kaikkonen  from the Centre Party says he lives 30 kilometres north of Helsinki in Tuusula in an electrically-heated detached home and primarily uses a car for travel.  Sanna Marin , transport and communications minister from the Social Democratic Party, lives in a district heating-warmed apartment in Tampere and says she uses a car when necessary. \n Green Party chair and interior minister  Maria Ohisalo  says she lives in a duplex with district heating in Helsinki's Viikki district and mostly get around by bike or public transport. Swedish People's Party chair and justice minister  Anna-Maja Henriksson  lives in the city of Jakobstad in western Finland in a detached home with direct electric heating and an air source heat pump. She also has a small apartment where she stays in Helsinki. She says she travels from her hometown to Helsinki by plane or train. \n The state provides chauffeur-driven cars to all ministers for reasons of safety and expedience. Most of the ministers responding to the questions say they will still try to walk and use public transport whenever they can. \n Filling a public physician void \n The nation's most widely-read daily, Helsingin Sanomat, has a story on  government's plans to hire 1,000 new doctors  to work at public health care centres. The paper reports that the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) recently revised its estimate of how many more doctors are required to bring public services up to speed to between 1,100 and 1,800. \n \"Municipalities have started to count on people of working age using occupational health care services and half of children being covered by private sickness insurance. The increased popularity of the active population opting for private services illustrates a deep mistrust of basic services,\" says  Kati Myllymäki  of the Finnish Medical Association, a professional organisation for doctors. \n Some 25 million visits to public health care centres were registered last year, 6.4 million involving the centres' doctors. Only eight percent of people in lowest income bracket have bought private insurance, compared with 30 percent of people in the highest income level. \n THL research director  Maria Vaalavuo  tells the paper that many high earners don't know what it is like to wait in line at a public health care centre \"because they have never done it\". She says that the lines are mostly filled with the unemployed, seniors and children without private coverage – groups that have \"little political clout\" that would urge municipalities to remedy the deteriorating situation. \n Warmer than usual, perhaps? \n And the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat has made a prediction concerning the  weather for the Midsummer weekend of 21-23 June , when most Finns head to their summer cottages from some rest and relaxation. \n Although \"it's hard to make forecasts in advance\", IS says the current prediction is looking good for the cherished holiday. \n \"Based on the monthly forecast you could say that southern Finland might see warmer temperatures than normal, so there's hope,\" Foreca meteorologist  Kristian Roine  tells the paper. \n Temperatures of around 24 degrees Celsius are being predicted for the Helsinki area's Midsummer weekend at present, while central and northern areas have forecasts of \"normal weather\" for the season, with temperatures around 20 degrees."}
{"text": "The Oulu-based paper  Kaleva reports on a proposal  by the Criminal Sanctions Agency, Rise, to reform the country's prison system, partly by centralising prisons in large cities and new growth centres. The proposed locations for correctional facilities would be the Helsinki region as well as Turku, Tampere, Jyväskylä, Kuopio, Oulu, Vaasa and Hämeenlinna. \n The paper's reporting is based on a memo acquired by the Lännen Media news consortium, which contains an analysis of the current prison network. The agency handed the document over to the Justice Ministry in April, Kaleva noted. \n \"We are hoping for a decision in next year's budget schedule, or by the end of this year,\" said Rise development manager  Pauli Nieminen . \n According to the analysis, there are roughly 7,000 convicts in the prison system, with 3,000 of them in custody at any given time. The proposed reforms would reduce the annual number of occupants by 1,000 a year in 20 years. At the same time the number of open prisons and the use of ankle monitors would increase to cover half of the system's inmates, compared to one-third today. \n Rise's overhaul of the prison system also calls for complete renovations to existing prisons. In the future, two-thirds of convicts would do time in new facilities. Rise expects that the rationalisation of the prison network would reduce annual spending by up to seven percent or 32 million euros in 20 years. Kaleva wrote that the vision also involves preventing recidivism or repeat offences by devoting an additional 260 person-years in resources to working with inmates, thereby further decreasing the annual prison population by 1,000 in 20 years. \n Baby bonus goes bust \n The tiny town of Sulkava in southeastern Finland found itself on the wrong side of the local administrative court when it tried to boost its population by introducing a kind of baby bonus, reports  the tabloid daily Ilta-Sanomat . \n The paper writes that with a population of just 2,500 give or take, city officials agreed to introduce  a baby bonus in the form of a tax rebate . However the measure proved to be illegal because it set families on an unequal footing. City leaders agreed to the measure last February, however one councillor opposed it and filed a complaint with the local administrative court. \n The Eastern Finland Administrative Court sided with the complainant and revoked the benefit, which would have refunded taxes paid by families with babies born last year or this year as a fixed \"stipend\". It also blocked the city council from paying out any gratuities. \n The court estimated that a resident earning 1,500 euros a month would have paid 900 euros in local taxes last year, while another with a monthly salary of 5,000 euros would have contributed 11,600 euros in taxes. Both would have received the same stipend. IS concluded that residents in Sulkava apparently \"got busy between the sheets\" but got no baby bonus. \n Worries over apartment block suburbs \n Finland's 600-odd apartment block suburbs are in social and economic decline and pose a challenge to the incoming government,  according to research highlighted  by capital-based daily Helsingin Sanomat. \n The paper unravels the work of Helsinki University researcher  Mats Stjernberg , whose urban geography dissertation argued that concentrations of multi-story flats feature higher levels of unemployment and lower incomes than other areas. Stjernberg also found that on average, residents of such communities also fell ill more often and died younger than people living in other areas. \n Apartment blocks constructed in the 1960s and 70s account for one-third of all residential buildings in the country. However they are now coming to the end of their useful lives, Stjernberg said. That means a cycle of costly renovations to homes that are less likely to sell on the real estate market. While it makes sense to spend on home improvements in Helsinki, homes are likely to be demolished  in other locations experiencing population loss , the dissertation argued. \n HS writes that the new administration led by  Antti Rinne  is worried about the situation. It aims to build new transportation connections and affordable housing as well as strengthen local democracy. It has developed a cross-governmental programme to promote wellbeing and inclusiveness and to revitalise residential areas. \n The price of a ticket to Parliament \n With the deadline approaching for MPs to declare their political campaign spending,  IS runs an analysis of incoming lawmakers' campaign budgets . Topping the list of big spenders was the National Coalition Party's  Pauli Kiuru , whose overall ticket to parliament cost nearly 77,000 euros, of which 18,096 came from donors. According to IS, Kiuru's out-of pocket spending -- around 59,000 euros -- could buy a fancy car or even pay off a loan. The paper asked Kiuru if it made sense to invest that much in a job. \n \"Before the election, Ilta-Sanomat wrote a story saying that Pauli Kiuru has the cheapest car of all MPs, a 1,500-euro Mazda. I have no loans and I have a second [investment] home. Now I also have a job for four years,\" Kiuru countered. \n Prime Minister Antti Rinne was also a major league spender with a declared campaign budget of 62,691 euros, all of it coming from well-wishers. \n At the far end of the spectrum, NCP MP and former television personality  Jaana Pelkonen  got more bang for her campaign buck than any of her parliamentary colleagues. According to her declaration, she spent a total of just 872 euros on her campaign, more than half of which (487 euros) came from donors. \n IS noted that with the filing deadline due on 17 June, just one-third of elected MPs had filed campaign spending declarations."}
{"text": "Newly-minted Social Affairs and Health Minister  Aino-Kaisa Pekonen  has issued assurances that the new government is already taking steps to roll back  the highly unpopular activation model  introduced by the previous administration to get unemployed people into jobs. The plan was part of the previous government's ambition to reform the labour market and boost the employment rate to 72 percent,  a target it achieved at the end of last year . \n The scheme required the unemployed to either enrol in a training programme, bill a minimum of 241 euros or perform 18 hours of paid work in each three-month period. Failure to do so resulted in the authorities docking their unemployment benefit by 4.65 percent a month, amounting to a 32.40-euro cut in the 696-euro benefit from the Social Insurance Institution (Kela). \n During the first review period after the model was introduced by  Juha Sipilä 's administration at the beginning of 2018, roughly  94,000 people suffered benefits cuts  for failing to meet the criteria. \n On Monday, Pekonen took to Twitter to signal that work was underway to strike down the scheme. \n \"The activation model is being dismantled. Many have asked and I want to answer clearly. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is already preparing to terminate the model and the change will be implemented as quickly as possible, while paying attention to good legislative practice and the need for changes in Kela's systems,\" the minister tweeted. \n Questions over administration's plans \n Kela, Finland's principal benefits agency, was responsible for rolling out two of the previous government's flagship labour market reforms,  the activation model  and  a widely-publicised basic income experiment . \n The new administration's plans to bin the activation model have raised some questions. According to the government programme, the model will be discontinued when the cabinet has concluded certain \"employment-related measures\". \n Before the election, current government partners, the Left Alliance and Prime Minister  Antti Rinne 's Social Democratic Party  had promised to eliminate the model , which was widely seen as unjust. \n A citizens' initiative to dismantle the scheme gathered broad support and  was handed to lawmakers  soon after the model was introduced."}
{"text": "Finland's  Non-Discrimination Ombudsman ,  Kirsi Pimiä , says that the youth wing of the nationalist Finns Party (FP) is suspected of unlawful ethnic harassment and that one of its social media posts was clearly incompatible with the aims of the Youth Act. \n Pimiä declared that the youth group violated the ban on discrimination based on ethnic origin or had at least offended the human dignity of dark-skinned Finns. \n She was responding to a post on the youth branch's Twitter account last month. It showed a dark-skinned family with a text urging people to vote for the FP in the European Parliament election \"so that Finland's future doesn't look like this\". \n The Ministry of Education and Culture had asked the Ombudsman for a determination as to whether the FP youth organisation's action was compatible with the Non-Discrimination Act. Pimiä wrote in her statement that the action was in clear violation of the equality clause of the Youth Act. \n State may withdraw subsidy \n The ministry may claw back 115,000 euros in state aid granted to the FP youth for this year due to the tweet. \n The youth group has responded to this threat by saying that the post was \"an individual member's Twitter post made in error, which does not represent the organisation's stance\". The tweet was posted by the group's deputy chair,  Toni Jalonen . \n The youth wing later  deleted the tweet  and said it was thoughtless and contrary to accepted moral principles. \n According to Pimiä, the comments in response to the tweet indicated that at least some of those in leadership positions in the FP youth group believed that the post was intended to spread an \"ethno-nationalist\" message emphasising the status of the white population. \n Concerns raised earlier in spring \n \"It is worth noting that the post was published on a communications channel of the youth organisation of the second-largest party in the Finnish Parliament, and that comments related to the message that are offensive to human dignity have not been deleted,\" Pimiä said in her statement. \n The Ombudsman says that the actions demonstrate a fundamental lack of respect for dark-skinned people and are offensive to these people. \n Police are also  investigating the case . \n In March, well before the social media post, the Education Ministry had already summoned a representative of the FP youth to discuss the ministry's concerns about the group's previous statements on immigration, which it suspected were in violation of the aims of the Youth Act. \n Finns Party chair Jussi Halla-aho and a number of other FP politicians have been convicted of online hate speech over the years. The party is one seat short of being the largest in the new Finnish Parliament, and has led public opinion polls in recent weeks."}
{"text": "The capital city daily Helsingin Sanomat starts out the day with  an analysis of the parliamentary floor debate  between Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  and National Coalition Party chair  Petteri Orpo  in yesterday's plenary session. The paper says the reasons why the centre-right NCP was left out of the new left-leaning government were made clear after Orpo repeatedly questioned the financial sustainably of the  incoming coalition's agenda . \n \"The NCP didn't fit in because we refused to fall for this huge bluff,\" Orpo reportedly said, criticizing the Social Democratic premier for a government programme that adds to the deficit and \"showers money on more than a hundred different targets\". \n Rinne said that his government aims to create 60,000 new jobs that will strengthen the economy and make it possible to fund the \"necessary added expenditures\", therefore creating what he calls \"social sustainability\". The paper says Orpo was visibly irritated during the lengthy exchange, while Rinne remained calm. \n The Finns Party, now the largest opposition party in Finland, in turn criticized the government's plans to add several more ministerial assistant positions and increase development assistance levels, HS reports. The populist party was also critical of agenda policies that would make housing costs and car use more expensive. \n \"You, dear government, are leading Finland along the path to destruction, in direct defiance of the people's wishes,\"  Ville Tavio , the parliamentary chair of the Finns Party said on Tuesday. \n Debate of the government programme continues Wednesday. Parliament will hold a vote on the plan on Thursday, and since Rinne's five-party coalition enjoys a  comfortable majority  the programme is expected to pass. \n Taken by the ankles \n The Tampere-based newspaper Aamulehti looks at  the new government's plan to extend the use of ankle monitors to persons who have received negative asylum decisions in Finland . \n Criminal Sanctions Agency (Rise) senior specialist  Pia Andersson  tells the paper that if this added electronic monitoring is added to the responsibilities of the agency \"it would require legislation granting that power and additional resources to manage it.\" The government programme proposes  expanding the use of ankle monitors  as a more-liberating alternative to detention that is nevertheless appropriate to safeguard public safety. The monitor is connected to a device in the person's home that tracks their coming and going. Any deviations from approved routines are then reported to Rise's national monitoring system. \n Ankle monitors can also be linked to GPS devices for clear monitoring of the wearers' location at all times, the paper writes. Trips outside of an approved area, for example, trigger an alarm, as does any attempt to remove the device. \n Top levels of trust again \n And the Lahti-based paper Etelä-Suomen Sanomat contains a  story  on how Finland came out on top once again in an international survey of 38 countries' trust in the news media. The  2019 Digital News Report  from Reuters Institute found that 59 percent of Finnish residents say that they can trust Finnish news sources. \n \"This is probably due to the Finns’ general trust in social institutions and the fact that the mainstream news media are not politically divided. It seems, though, that even in Finland things are slowly changing. Overall trust in the news is now down nine percentage points from 2015, though trust in ‘news I consume’ dropped only 2 percentage points,\" University of Tampere researcher  Esa Reunanen  says. \n This year's survey also suggests that more than half of Finland's residents regularly get their news online. Some 62 percent report using smartphones to access news on a weekly basis, while 43 percent say mobiles are their main devices for accessing news content, up from 39 percent last year. Further, 39 percent indicated they access news from social media feeds. \n The report ranks the weekly reach of Finland's news agencies, with public broadcaster Yle on top in the category of TV, radio and print outlets, while tabloid papers Ilta-Sanomat and Iltalehti are the most widely used sources for online news."}
{"text": "The Kuopio-based  Savon Sanomat  writes that Finland's new five-party coalition government, headed by Social Democratic Party chair  Antti Rinne , is expected to breeze through its first challenge from the opposition. \n The government's programme came in for sharp criticism on a floor debate on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the course of that debate the National Coalition Party, the Finns Party and the Christian Democrats each filed a motion of no-confidence. \n As this paper points out, the Finns Party is critical of moves by the government which it says will raise the costs of housing and motoring, while the National Coalition Party has come down hard on the cabinet's economic policy proposals and is demanding action  to improve employment . \n The government, which includes the SDP, Centre, Greens, Left Alliance and Swedish People's Party, commands 117 votes in the 200 member parliament. In addition,  Harry Harkimo , who is the sole MP of the Movement Now (Liike Nyt) group, has also announced his support for the government. The no-confidence vote is scheduled for early Thursday afternoon. \n Network services still down in Lahti \n Lahti's  Etelä-Suomen Sanomat  reports that network connections for the health and social services operations of the City of Lahti and the Päijät-Häme region have been suspended to prevent the spread of  malware that infected Lahti's public sector computer system  on Tuesday. \n According to the paper, the infection started with a single computer and spread to around another one thousand. \n Etelä-Suomen Sanomat tells its readers to expect significant disruptions in services at public healthcare centres and dental clinics. Clients of social services offices will also be impacted. \n Patients in need of acute care are being advised to phone health advisory services. Appointments already booked at healthcare centres are being handled, but officials say that some procedures may not be possible and will require a new visit at a later date. \n As of Thursday morning, computer-based patient records, laboratory results and x-ray images were unavailable, and the system of e-prescriptions was offline. \n Officials are as of yet unable to say how long the disruptions may last. Further information is to be made available on Friday. \n Impact of new rape law \n Turun Sanomat presents some  expert legal opinion  on what  newly proposed legislation  redefining rape may mean in the courts. \n If passed by parliament, the new rape law would be based on a lack of consent rather than threats or violence, as is the case now. \n Matti Tolvanen , Professor of Criminal Law at the University of Eastern Finland, told Turun Sanomat that he does not believe that redefining rape will lead to significantly more convictions. He pointed to the fact that it will not change the problem of evidence, that there are rarely eyewitnesses to rape and cases often come down to one person's word against another's. This is very difficult for prosecutors. \n Tolvanen added, though that while the change in the number of convictions may remain small, it will undoubtedly affect attitudes. \n \"In the long run, the effect may be quite significant. The message to society is that individuals have the right to self determination and that must be respected,\" said Professor Tolvanen. \n Tolvanen also believes that the new law may lower the threshold for people to report rapes to the authorities. \n Budget threads \n Ask the average Finn where they got their latest summer apparel, and you're likely to hear something like, ”just past the sporting goods section, three aisles over from the frozen fish counter\". \n The capital daily Helsinki Sanomat reports on  a fresh survey  by the Finnish Commerce Federation showing that the most popular place for people in Finland to buy clothing is at hypermarkets and discount retailers. \n The survey, carried out in March-April of this year found that first place was held by Prisma chain hypermarkets where 34 percent of shoppers said they had purchased clothing over the past year. In second place were the Tokmanni discount stores and in third were Citymarket chain hypermarkets. \n Swedish-based clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz came in fourth. \n HS points out that instead of fashion sense, the main criteria for Finnish shoppers is price. Finnish households spend less on average on clothing and footwear than most EU consumers. \n In addition, according to  Terhi-Anna Wilska , a professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä specialised in consumerism, the hypermarket phenomenon probably reflects the ageing population. The older one gets, she says, the more comfort takes precedence over fashion. \n What Finnish consumers say they are looking for when they shop for clothes is comfort, practicality, and outfits that can be worn in as many different settings as possible."}
{"text": "The Länsi-Uusimaa district court has convicted local politician and former MTV3 news anchor  Seppo Huhta  on charges of ethnic agitation over Facebook posts he wrote in 2016. \n In the posts, the alternate Espoo city councillor, who is said to be a member of the Blue Reform, called for Muslims to leave Europe and declared that they are not suited to civilised countries. The court also found that in the posts, which were written between January and February in 2016, Huhta used derogatory language to refer to Muslims and Somalis. \n The court convicted the former  Finns Party  member for writing what it deemed to be slanderous and abusive posts about Muslims and Somalis. It found that although Huhta’s intention was to present views that were critical of immigration and migrants convicted of criminal offences, he should not have slandered entire ethnic groups in the manner that he did. \n The court said that the comments constituted hate speech, were generalisations, and could generate contempt and hostility toward Somalis and Muslims. \n Defendant: Opinions based on political convictions \n The former television personality said his intention was to use the posts to criticise immigration policy and said that he shared opinions that were based on his political convictions. \n On the subject of his comments about crimes committed by immigrants, Huhta said that he was only referring to individuals found guilty of criminal activity. He described his language as colourful and said the terminology he used was commonplace. \n \"Although the use of language was in part inappropriate, the intention was only to highlight injustices and to stir up interest in the matter in the manner that he had learned as a journalist,\" court documents said of his defence. \n The court ordered the defendant to pay a 40-day fine, which represents a total of 400 euros. He was also called upon to delete several Facebook posts put up in 2016. \n Huhta still has the option of appealing the verdict, so the sentence is not yet enforceable. \n Questions over party membership \n According to the website of the city of Espoo, Huhta is a deputy councillor representing the Blue Reform, which split from the Finns Party in 2017. \n However in May, Blue Reform vice president  Tiina Ahva  denied that Huhta was a member of the party. \n \"Huhta is not and has never been a member of the Blue Reform,\" she wrote in an email at the time. \n During municipal elections in 2017, the ex-news reader lost his seat as councillor and became a reserve. He was a previous chair of the Blue Reform’s Espoo chapter."}
{"text": "Finland's Greens elected  Maria Ohisalo  as the party's new chair in their party congress in the western city of Pori on Saturday. The freshly-appointed interior minister was voted into the position unanimously. \n In her acceptance speech, Ohisalo emphasized her responsibilities as interior minister, saying the office was at the \"core of fundamental human rights\", as it is responsible for police operations, border control and immigration. \n \"I'm not frightened of trolls and I'm not afraid of Nazis,\" she said, perhaps foreseeing future conflicts with the largest opposition party in Parliament, the anti-immigrant Finns Party. \n The new Greens chair said that the fights against climate change and poverty were the most important political objectives. \n \"We must combat climate change in a way that gets everyone on board. The bill cannot be paid by only those who are already having troubles making ends meet. I want to build a Finland in which the societal safety net works,\" Ohisalo said. \n As a  PhD-level researcher of poverty , Ohisalo suggested she plans to use her knowledge and experience to address increasingly inequality in Finland. \n \"I know what poverty in this society is. I have lived it, I have seen it and I have researched it,\" she said. \n Haavisto's critical support \n Outgoing chair  Pekka Haavisto  – Finland's foreign minister as of early June – said in his speech that the Greens are now a cornerstone of Prime Minister  Antti Rinne 's five-party coalition. \n \"This is the greenest government programme in history. If there are any parts of the agenda that deviate from the Greens' own manifesto, it may be due to the fact that four other parties were  in attendance at the House of Estates ,\" he said. \n In his parting address to the congress, Haavisto also called to mind the party's situation last autumn, when then-chair  Touko Aalto  stepped down from his position due to health reasons and public support for the Greens of Finland began to fall. Maria Ohisalo briefly filled in for Aalto until a new chair could be elected, but said she was unavailable to continue as chair, despite her clear popularity. \n As the party's two-time presidential candidate and one-time chair in the mid-nineties, Haavisto agreed to step into the role temporarily, promising to secure election victories in the parliamentary and EU elections in the spring. \n He proved good on his word, after  the Greens won a record 20 MP seats in April  and  two MEP seats in May . If Brexit becomes a reality, the party will also gain a third MEP seat – giving Finland's Greens as many seats in the European Parliament as the country's centre-right National Coalition Party. \n History in the party wings \n 34-year-old Maria Ohisalo was named Finland's new interior minister in June, after the Greens' historic victory at the polls earned her a first-term seat in parliament. \n Even though she had been unsuccessful in earlier attempts to gain a MP position, the doctor of social sciences had been busy behind the scenes, serving as the party's youth wing chair in 2013-2014 and as deputy chair of the party since 2015. She has also held a seat as a representative of the Greens on the Helsinki City Council from 2017 to 2019."}

{"text": "A fresh Yle party approval survey conducted by pollster Taloustutkimus has shown declining support for the Social Democratic Party led by Prime Minister  Antti Rinne . Backing for the party declined by 1.3 percentage points to 16.1 percent after  the new SDP-led administration publicised its four-year government programme  at the beginning of June. \n That level of voter support places the SDP in third position behind the Finns Party and the National Coalition Party, which appear to be already reaping the benefits of being in opposition. \n The nationalist Finns Party remains the country’s most popular political force with 19.7 percent voter backing, while the NCP has 16.8 percent – the parties are separated by nearly three percentage points, still well within the poll’s margin of error of +/- 1.9 percentage points. \n Taloustutkimus research director  Tuomo Turja  said that the Finns Party is clearly the most popular group among workers, but is also faring well among entrepreneurs. \n \"The Finns Party is gaining on the National Coalition Party as the largest business [–friendly] party,\" Turja commented. \n Challenges to coalition cooperation \n Government parties occupy rankings from fourth to seventh place in the survey. The Greens remain stable in fourth place with 14.3 percent backing. However there appears to be no reprieve for the Centre, led by interim chair  Juha Sipilä , which has seen voter approval erode from one poll to another. \n The latest Yle survey puts support for the party at just 11.7 percent, down slightly by 0.7 percentage points from a previous barometer. It is a record low for the party that once held the reins of government. \n According to Turja’s reading of the numbers, the Finns Party in particular has gobbled up support from the limping Centre. At the same time many Centre backers are undecided about where to pitch their tents. \n \"Many that voted Centre in the recent parliamentary election cannot say at this time which party they support. It seems that the Centre’s participation in government has to some extent confused their support base,\" Turja said. \n During government formation talks, the Centre and the Greens appeared to be on opposite sides of the fence on a number of issues,  such as immigration policy . The pollster speculated that the Greens’ continued expansion is likely to challenge cooperation between the two parties. \n The agrarian-background Centre is now  looking ahead to leadership elections  in September in the hope that a new chair will help revive the party’s fortunes in voter polls. The frontrunners in that contest are currently Economic Affairs Minister  Katri Kulmuni  and Defence Minister  Antti Kaikkonen . \n Left Alliance chipping away at SDP support \n Another junior government partner, the Left Alliance, posted the biggest gains in this poll to record 8.8 percent voter backing, an increase of one percentage point on the last poll. \n Turja said that the Left Alliance has managed to attract support from the groups of voters who appear to have soured on the SDP. \n \"I interpret this as inter-governmental [movement]. Some of voters choosing between the SDP and Left Alliance have opted for the Left Alliance this time,\" he pointed out. \n In spite of slight changes in the level of support for the five government coalition parties, overall support for the bloc remains largely the same as during the general election. Total voter backing for the administration now stands at 55.5 percent, compared to 55.7 percent gathered during the election. \n Taloustutkimus interviewed nearly 2,500 voters between 5 June and 2 July for the poll. \n Yle’s political barometer will take a break during the summer vacation and will return during the autumn parliamentary term, when voters will likely be evaluating the performance of both the government and the opposition."}

Study grant eligibility has also been capped at 48 months and so collecting the 250 euros per month through the summer eats away at this total, creating stress and forcing students to rely more heavily on student loans. \n Lahtinen says that if there is political will, the study grant cap could be increased to 60 months. This would provide 12 monthly payments for five years, the time in which university students are expected to attain a master's degree in Finland. He stresses that the proposed change has to be analysed thoroughly before it can be taken into use, however, as the apparent solution to one problem could end up creating a string of new ones. \n One-third has faith in new coalition \n The Joensuu-based newspaper Karjalainen reports on a new Kantar TNS Gallup survey that found that  35 percent of respondents judged the ability of Prime Minister  Antti Rinne 's left-leaning government to run the country for the next four years as \"very or somewhat good\" . A similar percentage had their doubts, and the rest wouldn't say one way or another. \n This measure of confidence is six to eight percentage points weaker than that enjoyed by the centre-right coalition formed by Rinne's predecessor  Juha Sipilä  after taking office in 2015 in a matching survey. \n The Municipal Development Foundation-commissioned poll suggested that people's trust in the Rinne coalition nevertheless outweighed their trust in the opposition, as only 28 percent of respondents agreed that the parties leading the opposition have the \"competence to take care of Finnish affairs and offer the government political alternatives\". \n Balancing books as a school subject \n The tabloid Iltalehti carries the results of another survey assessing Finnish residents' opinion of teaching basic financial skills as a part of the core curriculum. \n The IROResearch poll, commissioned by the Finnish Foundation for Share Promotion, found that  80 percent of respondents agreed that basic money management principles should be a compulsory subject in Finnish schools . The most important topics respondents suggested should be covered included everyday money use, saving, investing and sustainable consumption. A full 94 percent of respondents said that budgeting and the everyday use of personal money streams were skills that every Finnish residents should master. \n In exchange, respondents were most willing to cut back on religion/ethics instruction, with one-quarter ready to sacrifice some Swedish language instruction and one-fifth prepared to arrange fewer art classes. \n Bank of Finland board member  Marja Nykänen  tells IL that Finland needs to come up with a national financial education strategy like the kind recommended by the OECD. \"After this step, we could better enhance and coordinate financial literacy.\" \n Valuable paintings resurface \n And Finland's other major tabloid Ilta-Sanomat finishes today's review with a story on  two oil paintings from the celebrated Finnish artist  Helene Schjerfbeck  discovered in the estate of a Tampere dentist . \n An auction will be arranged to sell the works, with \"Reading Girl\" expected to fetch 250,000 euros and \"Yellow Roses\" another 200,000 euros.  Pirkka Lehtinen-Sillanpää , the deceased, indicated in her last will and testament her wish that the proceeds of the sale of the paintings - which have been out of the public eye for 50 years - be donated to charity. \n \"It is rare to come across top finds like this in estates. The owner was a real art lover, as there were several other major works in her collection,\" auctioneer  Jukka Takala  tells IS. \n Helene Schjerfbeck  (1862–1946) is best known for her series of self-portraits and a painting entitled \" The Convalescent \". \n This past Saturday,  The Guardian in the UK ran a lengthy story  on \"Finland's Munck\" ahead of a major exhibition of Schjerfbeck's work at the Royal Academy of Arts opening 20 July in London."}

I told them that the Finnish state has been working hard to find a solution to the situation,\" Rinne said in a statement afterwards. \n The meeting was part of the cabinet ministers' fact-finding process regarding the situation, according to the Council of State. Last month, a couple of weeks after taking office, the new premier told Parliament that there were \"no plans to use consular services to bring these people to Finland\". \n Supo responds to criticism \n In an Yle interview on Wednesday morning, Professor  Martin Scheinin  criticised the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) for labelling all the Finns at al-Hol as a security threat. Scheinin is Professor of International Law and Human Rights at the European University Institute and a former UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism. \n Later that day, Supo denied that it is evaluating those who left the Isis territory and are now at al-Hol as one group, but rather that each case is being considered separately. \n \"According to current information there are about 10 Finnish women and about 30 children at the camp,\" the agency said on Wednesday. Previously officials have said there were 11 women and 33 children there. \n \"An immense challenge\" \n IS family members were evacuated to al-Hol earlier this year when the extremist group lost the last of its territory. \n The Finnish Red Cross (FRC) said last month that the camp held some 74,000 people, 90 percent of them women and children. An estimated 10,000 are foreigners. \n The UN has called on western countries to help bring their citizens home from the remote desert camp near the Iraqi border. The International Red Cross recently described conditions there as \"horrifying\". \n Eight FRC aid workers are among the staff of a 30-bed Nordic field hospital that opened at the site last month. \n \"More than 64,000 people have come to the al-Hol camp since December. More than half of these people are children. The bearing capacity of the camp has already been exceeded, and trying to meet people’s needs is an immense challenge,\" the FRC's head of international disaster aid,  Tiina Saarikoski , said last month. \n On Thursday, a German court ruled that three children and their mother, originally from northern Germany, must be located and repatriated from al-Hol."}

The current administration isn't even unanimous on universal basic income,\" Pekonen told Uutissuomalainen. \n Initial findings from Finland's  two-year basic income experiment  that concluded at the end of 2018 found that giving 2,000 unemployed people 560 euros tax-free every month did not increase participants’ employment, but recipients did report higher perceived wellbeing than that of those in the control group."}
{"text": "The discussion around politicians blocking critics on social media is heating up in Finland. \n Earlier this week a federal court in the United States ruled that President Donald Trump couldn't block his critics on Twitter because his account was seen as a public forum, a virtual town hall where citizens can engage with his comments. \n That same discussion is now developing in Finland, where media researcher  Jukka-Pekka Puro  said representatives of the Left Alliance and Greens have engaged in the most blocking of followers due to the high volume of inappropriate messages they receive. \n \"I get that users will block accounts sending particularly aggressive messages. But it's not always easy to determine where to draw the line,\" Puro said. \n At the end of 2017, former Greens chair  Touko Aalto  blocked Centre party MP  Mikko Kärnä  for what Aalto called inappropriate comments. \n \"Parliamentarians usually engage in civilised discussions online since they have to get along on the job. But that’s not to say that they have to put up with everything,\" communications professor  Pekka Isotalus  from the University of Tampere explained. \n Democratic participation at stake \n Problems arise from a democratic standpoint when powerful politicians prevent people from participating in public discussion by blocking users. \n In October 2018 Chancellor of Justice  Tuomas Pöysti  ruled that then-premier  Juha Sipilä  had the right to block users from his Twitter account because it was his personal and not official government account. \n Greens chair and Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo  meanwhile unblocked newsstand tabloid Ilta-Sanomat’s editor-in-chief  Ulla Appelsin  from her Twitter account after taking up a ministerial post this spring. \n Media researcher Puro said politicians need to be able to withstand criticism. \n \"The more powerful a politician, the more carefully they should weigh the decision to block someone,\" he explained. \n Puro said the time may be ripe for a non-politically aligned organ to issue social media blocking guidelines for elected officials. \n However in the future, political discussions may shift away from Twitter and onto Instagram due to the platform's popularity with young people, according to Puro."}

{"text": "A citizen's initiative to reform Finland's mining law has received 50,000 signatures, meaning that the proposal now qualifies for consideration on the parliamentary floor. \n The initiative seeks to make major changes to Finland's Mining Act which came into effect in 2011. \n \"On the local level, municipalities should have a better opportunity to have a say about land use in their area,\" says  Jukka Leppänen , chair of the Pro Heinävesi movement and one of the two authors of the initiative. \n He says the reformed law should also do more to protect valuable nature sites and waterways, as well as make provisions to ensure that more of the benefits stemming from minerals found in Finnish soil are returned to the municipalities and state. \n The citizens' initiative also demands mining companies be required to demonstrate sufficient collateral up front for dealing with any potential environmental damage, for example. \n \"If we could create a fund system, for example, that would make it easier to clear up environmental accidents,\" Leppänen says. \n The reform bid also calls on MPs to change the process by which mining permits are granted. As the law now stands, parties can be granted operational permits before they have been cleared for permits associated with Finnish laws on environmental conservation. If the amendments included in the citizens' initiative are approved by Parliament, companies would in future have to secure an environmental permit first. \n \"It feels as if there were clear, substantial mistakes in the renewed 2011 Mining Act, despite that fact that most of it hasn't even been executed yet in practice,\" Leppänen said. \n \"Triumph of democracy\" \n Just one week ago, Leppänen was unsure that the initiative would meet its 50K signature target within the six-month limit. \n \"Support levelled out for a bit, but then we launched an effective social media blitz that got people on board. I feel a deep sense of gratitude. This is a triumph of democracy, in a way,\" he said. \n Finland introduced citizens' initiatives to the lawmaking process in March 2012. \n The new form of direct democracy allows one or more Finnish citizens to propose the amendment or repeal of existing legislation. If 50,000 Finnish citizens sign on with their support within six months of submitting the proposal, the Finnish Parliament is then obliged to discuss it in plenary session."}

{"text": "Finnish Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  says recent interference with safe passage in and around the Strait of Hormuz should be globally condemned. \n \"It is extremely concerning when one of the world's most important sea routes is exposed to activity akin to piracy,\" he said. \n The minister's comments refer to the  seizure of the Stena Impero oil tanker , sailing under a British flag, which was boarded and captured by Iranian forces on 19 July. \n It was later revealed that the  tanker was seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in retaliation for the British seizure of an Iranian tanker , intercepted on 4 July in Gibraltar on suspicion of smuggling oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions. \n British authorities claim a  second tanker  was also seized on Friday. Iran said the vessel was boarded because it was involved in an accident,  an explanation Britain rejected . \n In an earlier incident in mid-June, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also accused Iran of being behind attacks on two other oil tankers in the strait. Iran denied the accusations. \n \"Diplomacy is needed\" \n Haavisto said that it is in the best interests of countries like Finland who are dependent on world trade to defend the freedom to navigate and condemn attacks on ships. He said the incidents were clearly meant to attract attention, obstruct shipping in the waters off Iran and make maritime traffic unsafe. \n The Finnish foreign minister said that the most important thing at the moment is to secure the safety of the crew on the captured vessel and proceed along diplomatic channels. \n \"This is also the position of the British foreign office,\" Haavisto said. \n Haavisto pointed out that the European Union has been in support of a constructive and peaceful policy with regard to Iran. He considers it unfortunate that the US abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, which had been negotiated for 12 years. \n \"But Iran has now started to pose a threat and exceed the agreed-upon uranium limits, which is even worse,\" he said. \n \"EU must stand united\" \n Britain has told its ships to avoid entering the strait for the time being, and  France  and  Germany  have joined Britain in condemning Iran's activity. \n A third of the world’s liquefied natural gas and almost 20 percent of total global oil consumption passes through the strait between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, making it a highly important strategic location for international trade. \n \"If maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz is hampered and vessels begin to seek out alternative routes, it will greatly impact not only Iran but also the other countries in the region. The EU must stand united behind the principle that freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz is preserved, and that no ships from EU member states or any other country fall victim to these kinds of attacks,\" Haavisto said."}
{"text": "Leadership of the Russian Federation seriously considered selling the Republic of Karelia back to Finland in 1991, according to an  interview  with former Russian deputy foreign minister  Andrey Fedorov  in the Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat. The territory in question, located beyond the eastern border of Finland, was ceded to the Soviet Union during WWII. \n In opposition to his earlier statements on the matter, however, Fedorov now told the paper that the Finnish government was never informed that such an option was even on the table. \n In July of 1991, it had been 18 months since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Soviet Union had crumbled and newly appointed President  Boris Yeltsin  struggled to hold the Russian Federation together. \n His fledgling government compiled a list of territories with nationalist factions that could potentially rise up and demand autonomy or create border disputes. The Republic of Karelia was included due to what was perceived as rising insurgency in the area, Fedorov told the paper. \n Later that same year, the state coffers of the former USSR were running low. At this juncture, Yeltsin and his team went to so far as to calculate a 15-billion-dollar asking price for the ceded territory, Fedorov said, with the aim to possibly offer it to Finland. \n Adjusted for inflation, the modern-day equivalent of the price that was settled on by the Russian authorities is 22.5 billion euros. \n Contradictory statements \n This is not the first time Fedorov has gone public with his claims. The former deputy minister of foreign affairs first spoke of old Russian designs to sell Karelia in August 2007. \n At that time, he claimed that then-Finnish President  Mauno Koivisto  and Foreign Minister  Paavo Väyrynen  were aware of unofficial discussions on the matter, but now he told the paper that the deal was never revealed to anyone outside of Russia. \n \"The discussions in the Russian government were held behind closed doors,\" he told the paper in 2019. \n Väyrynen has also said he has no recollection of ever discussing the matter with Russian officials. \n Fedorov said the Russian Federation decided later, in 1994, that the so-called \" Karelian question \" was officially closed."}

The biggest problems, according to HS, are caused by eutrophication, which occurs when water becomes overly enriched with minerals and nutrients - much of which comes from agricultural runoff. This in turn creates oxygen-depleting levels of algae, ultimately spreading “silent death” along the bottom of the sea. \n The article describes the problems facing the \"wonderful, miserable, unique, vulnerable\" Baltic Sea; from the \"greenish yellow porridge\" on the beach to the slimy green algae that obscures the view to the seabed. Canoeists and sailors have begun to steer clear of the Archipelago Sea in July, according to HS, and fish caught there may not be suitable for consumption by children or pregnant women. \n The Baltic Sea is however \"beautiful in its own special way, and worth saving,\" and efforts to conserve the sea have been ongoing since the 1974 signing of the Convention for the Protection of the Baltic Sea.

However, the university confirmed to the tabloid that al-Taee never completed either of these courses. The univerisity confirmed that the MP did receive a degree from the institution for a 2016 thesis on the role of Iraq's pension system in supporting stability and growth of the country. \n Furthermore, the paper reveals that al-Taee’s claim to have received a diploma in ‘International Relations and Diplomacy’ from the University of Lincoln in the UK was also not corroborated by the awarding university, which instead has a record of al-Taee studying International Management. \n IL report that al-Taee’s LinkedIn page was updated after they began their investigation, and the paper asked the politician to explain how and why this happened in an email exchange on Monday. \n “I have not been active on LinkedIn, so my profile information was incomplete and inaccurate,” al-Taee told the tabloid. \n 'Cartoon Oscar' for Finnish artist  \n Turku daily Turun Sanomat reports on the success of local cartoonist  Max Sarin , who was awarded two Eisner awards - often known as the Cartoon Oscars - at the Comic-Con event in San Diego. \n According to TS, Sarin and his fellow cartoonists  John Allison  and  Julia Madrigal  won in both the 'Best Continuing Series' and the 'Best Humor Publication' categories for their comic series  Giant Days .

He added that there is also a possibility that the entire system would be axed. \n \"I don’t believe that it has produced a single new job. It has been a benefits cut that has increasingly pushed people toward [reliance on] income support.

He pointed to the system of regular interviews of unemployed persons as one example of a useful addition. He said that government working groups are currently trying to determine the employment impact of the activation system. \n The PM explained that legal issues have slowed down dismantling of the model. He added that it would not be enough to tackle the benefit-cutting aspect of the system and said that the administration preferred to deal with all possible reforms with a single legislative proposal. \n \"It could be that in the final analysis we would water down [jobseekers’] obligations in some way. That would allow us to get rid of the benefits cut,\" he noted. \n Tinder setup for wage subsidies \n The government is expected to bring new, fast-acting employment-boosting measures to budget talks due to begin in the autumn. It has also asked labour market organisations to submit proposals that would help it meet job creation and employment targets, but Rinne stressed that it has not imposed any empirical targets for them. \n Rinne said that one idea that the new administration is mulling is a proposal that would make it easier for individuals to apply for wage subsidies. \n The system would involve rolling out an online service in which unemployed jobseekers could apply for a wage subsidy that is equivalent to the labour market subsidy. At the same time, employers would be told whether or not they are able to hire an employee using the wage subsidy. The result would be a kind of wage subsidy Tinder service. \n \"Bringing these people together would simplify the process and could create tens of thousands of new jobs,\" Rinne speculated. \n The government’s goal is to get at least 60,000 people into jobs and to raise the employment rate to 75 percent during its four-year term. The entire government programme is largely predicated on improving  the current employment rate of around 72 percent . However economists have expressed caution over  slowing economic growth  and bearish employment prospects."}

{"text": "Finnish police are currently examining inflammatory comments from three members of parliament, after requests to investigate the legality of the public remarks were submitted to the authorities. The newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (HS)  reports  that preliminary stances on the matter are expected from the police and prosecutors in the coming week. \n The first investigation request concerns  Facebook posts  from  first-term  Social Democrat MP  Hussein Al-Taee , who admitted several weeks ago to writing text that was disparaging of minorities in 2011-2012. \n Inspector  Pekka Hätönen  from the Helsinki Police now told the paper that Al-Taee's dated comments may still be made subject to a criminal investigation. The National Bureau of Investigation had earlier stated that the police would not begin an investigation into the fledgling MP's old posts, but the Helsinki Police have since reconsidered the statutes of limitation with regards to the case. \n Ethnic agitation is a crime in Finland. The law defines it as a person who makes available to the public an expression of opinion or another message where a certain group is threatened, defamed or insulted on the basis of its race, skin colour, birth status, national or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation or disability. \n The maximum time within which legal proceedings may be initiated for suspected crimes of this nature is five years after the event. \n HS reports that the authorities are now reconsidering an investigation request because it could be construed that a suspected ethnic agitation crime could conceivably continue for as long as the posts are on display. \n Al-Taee has publicly apologized for his remarks. \n Comments on Pride, immigrants as alien species \n The second investigation request being considered by the police concerns tweets from former interior minister and current Christian Democrat MP  Päivi Räsänen  on Helsinki Pride 2019. \n Räsänen  criticized the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland's decision  to defend the rights of sexual minorities by signing on as an official partner in the event. \n Räsänen tweeted that she found it regrettable that \"sin and shame\" had been elevated as a source of pride. She included a still photo of New Testament verses which speak of \"vile affections\", among other things \n On 4 August, Räsänen posted on Twitter that she had not been told about any investigation requests, and heard about it for the first time in the media. She also said that \"she has faith that it is still allowed to quote the Bible\" in Finland. \n The third request for police investigation centres on a statement from Finns Party MP  Juha Mäenpää , who gave a speech on the floor of the Parliament in mid-June in which he equated immigrants with alien or invasive species. \n Freedom of expression in the Finnish Parliament is exceptionally broad. Even so, HS writes that things would get complicated if Mäenpää's remarks are found to meet the criteria of suspected ethnic agitation by the police and prosecutors. \n If the authorities reach this conclusion, the paper writes, the case would proceed to the body's constitutional law committee."}
{"text": "Finland’s revamped primary school curriculum will be fully put to the test when this year’s crop of first graders begin school. Unlike their peers before them, students starting school will receive all their instruction on the basis of a new national core curriculum approved in 2014,  writes largest circulation daily Helsingin Sanomat . \n The paper interviewed  Jukka Rantala  of Helsinki University, a professor of social education, who said that the curriculum may appear to some eyes to be quite vague. This, he noted, is deliberate. \n \"Municipalities create their own curricula and many schools even create their own on the basis of the curriculum’s fundamentals.\" \n Helena Thuneberg  of Helsinki University’s Centre for Educational Assessment CEA has conducted international comparisons of national core curricula and described the new syllabus as important. \n The  new syllabus focuses on skills development , which is part of a global trend in education, HS writes. The OECD has identified 12 important 21st-century skills, such as critical thinking, media literacy, leadership and initiative. \n The daily notes that the Finnish curriculum lays down seven broad areas of expertise that correspond to the OECD ideals. They include thinking and learning, cultural competency, self-care, multi-literacy, information and communications technology competence, working life skills and entrepreneurship as well as participation, empowerment and building a sustainable future. \n \"You can read between the lines and see the OECD skills set there,\" Thuneberg commented. \n An estimated 61,600 youngsters in Finland begin primary school on Thursday. It will be the first day of 8,512 hours of classroom instruction leading to the completion of their basic education in the spring of 2028. \n Bid to ease transition to primary school \n Meanwhile the Oulu-based daily Kaleva also focuses on education, covering a government proposal to  bundle pre-school with first- and second-grade education  to ensure a smooth transition to primary school for young learners. \n Kaleva picked up the piece from news consortium Uutissuomalainen, which reports that Education Minister  Li Andersson  has not yet provided details on how the possible reform might be implemented. \n According to Kaleva, Andersson said the option to flexibly merge pre- and early primary school instruction would be especially important in less populous municipalities with smaller class sizes. \n \"During these early years in particular, there are already large discrepancies in pupils’ competence due to natural development. Additionally, some may have special developmental difficulties,\" Andersson noted. \n As a result, the paper writes, the aim of the proposed reform is to reduce the level of difficulty some learners experience adjusting to school. Currently, about 100 children annually postpone starting school. \n Ample salaries for top public servants \n Tabloid daily Iltalehti has been diving into public records and crunching the numbers to report that Finland is  spending upwards of 500,000 euros every month  on the salaries of state secretaries and ministerial aides. \n According to the daily, government parties, the Social Democratic Party, Centre, Greens, Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party agreed during coalition formation talks on a total of 15 state secretaries and 69 special aides. In Finland, state secretaries assist ministers with political steering and planning work. \n The prime minister would have seven special assistants, while ministers also doubling as party leaders would be assigned five and other ministers would have three aides. IL reports that Prime Minister  Antti Rinne ’s state secretary  Raimo Luoma  currently earns 12,780 euros monthly (without a phone benefit) while other state secretaries' pay packet is 9,834 euros. \n The paper also noted that four ex-MPs who were voted out of the parliament in elections in April will earn nearly 10,000 euros a month for the next four years in roles as state secretaries. \n They are the Greens’  Olli-Poika Parviainen , now state secretary to Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo ;  Tuomu Puumala , a former Centre Party MP, who is now Science and Culture Minister  Annika Saarikko ’s state secretary; Centre parliamentary group state secretary  Kimmo Tiilikainen  as well as ex-SDP parliamentarian  Pilvi Torsti , right hand toSDP Labour Minister  Timo Harakka  . \n So far some 15 state secretaries and 62 special aides have been named to the cabinet."}
{"text": "The five-party government led by prime minister  Antti Rinne  has seen voter approval rise for the first time since it took office, according to a new Taloustutkimus survey for Yle. \n The poll shows that the administration has been buoyed by rising approval for the Greens. The Centre led by outgoing chair and ex-PM  Juha Sipilä  also saw signs of regaining some voter intentions during the survey period. \n \"Combined support for the government parties is now 57 percent. The administration has a mandate to govern,\" said Taloustutkimus research chief  Tuomo Turja . A  poll by daily Helsingin Sanomat at the end of July  put support for the government coalition at 55.3 percent. \n The pollster noted that although party polls have seen wild fluctuations in recent years, support for the largest opposition parties has remained constant over the past few months. The right-of-centre Finns Party remains the party the largest proportion of electors say they’ll vote for if an election were held now, with 19,6 percent of popular sentiment. This level of  support has more or less held steady  for the past couple of months. \n The National Coalition Party, which is also now in opposition after having been in government since 2007, also appears to have cemented its level of voter backing, recording 16.8 percent approval in the latest poll. Reading the numbers, Turja said that the Finns Party has claimed the mantle of the country’s largest workers’ party, however support from the business sector declined in the last survey. The NCP meanwhile, managed to boost its approval among the business class. \n Greens wake sleeping voters \n Turja noted that among the five-party coalition, the Greens were able to rouse sleeping voters among its own ranks and also poached some backing from the Left Alliance and the NCP to post 15.1 percent voter approval. \n The Centre shift the tide of its slow decline to post an improvement of 0.9 percentage-points and finish the poll with 12.6 percent support. \n \"It’s now reached rock bottom but it’s still there. Baseline support for the Centre appears to be around 12 percent,\" Turja observed. \n Turja added that after t he party’s election drubbing  followed by its confusing decision to join the government, some voters have returned to the fold. He noted that the slight rebound was driven by backing in its traditional strongholds. \n In addition, a look at weekly polling for the party showed no indication that its imminent leadership election was affecting levels of support. \n All of the movement in party approval scores were well within the poll's margin of error, +/- two percentage points. \n SDP support generally down in summer \n The downward slide in approval for Rinne’s SDP that began after the election also appears to have halted. Voter backing for the party stood at 16.3 percent in the latest survey, the same as in June. \n However the numbers suggest that the party suffers from a seasonal summer slump in the polls. Yle surveys from 2013 to 2017 indicate that the party always scores its lowest ratings in one of the summer months. \n Turja said that for some reason during the summer the party’s message fails to reach core supporters – blue- and white-collar workers – which was also the case in July this year. He added that the decline has taken place in key SDP territory such as western Finland and in provincial centres. \n In 2016 Rinne explained the decline in support by saying that during the summer, then-government ministers had greater opportunities for publicity because of their work. That hypothesis no longer applies now that his party is in government. \n Turja said that the new poll shows a typical post-election trend. \n \"During summer [overall] party support begins to fall, it’s close to 80 percent after elections and now it’s around 71 percent,\" he noted. \n \"After elections people are active about sharing their party affiliation, but I believe that during the autumn voters will be more uncertain.\" \n The pollster predicted greater movement in party support during the autumn after a quiet summer. Taloustutkimus interviewed 2,451 respondents between 8 July and 6 August for the survey. Nearly 1,750 of them revealed their party affiliations."}
{"text": "NGOs working to combat gambling addiction are calling for public health experts to be appointed to the board of the state-owned monopoly gambling operator Veikkaus. The non-profits say that the organisation focuses too heavily on making profits at the expense of reducing  problem gambling . \n Moreover, expertise on the drawbacks of excessive gambling plays \"a very small role\" on the Veikkaus board, according to  Inka Silvennoinen , a division manager of Peluuri, an NGO that helps combat  problem betting . \n Another grassroots organisation, the Finnish Association for Substance Abuse Prevention or Ehyt, called for Veikkaus to adopt a board composition similar to that of the state-owned alcohol monopoly retailer Alko, which typically has public health experts. According to executive director  Juha Mikkonen , the Alko board includes director general of the National Institute of Health and Welfare THL  Markku Tervahauta  as well as  Kirsi Varhila , a senior officer from the Social Affairs and Health Ministry. \n \"It would be preferable for the Veikkaus board, management and administrative bodies to also have expertise in preventing harmful gambling,\" Mikkonen declared. \n Sirpa Paatero , the minister responsible for government ownership steering, said that the administration would review the issue of board membership in the gambling firm during the autumn. \n \"I think it’s important that we consider this aspect when subsequent board members are selected,\" Paatero said by way of response. \n Veikkaus recently came under intense scrutiny and heavy criticism for  a radio advertising campaign that appeared to encourage frequent gamblers  to indulge the habit. \n Four politicians on Veikkaus board \n In addition to representatives of the business community, the Veikkaus board also comprises four politicians – unlike many other state-owned enterprises. They are MPs  Ilkka Kanerva  of the National Coalition Party and  Jutta Urpilainen  of the Social Democratic Party, as well as state secretary  Tuomo Puumala  of the Centre Party and former Finns Party MP  Raimo Vistbacka. \n Paatero noted that the decision to appoint the four politicians to the board was made during the previous administration led by Juha Sipilä, when Veikkaus merged with slot machine firm RAY and the horse racing and betting operation Fintoto. \n However she did not indicate whether or not the new government would be revisiting the politicians’ board appointments in autumn. She said that her understanding of the appointments was that they would bring a societal perspective to board deliberations. \n Veikkaus board members earn a monthly fee of 2,000 euros and an additional 600 euros for each meeting they attend. Some other large state-owned enterprises pay board members similar kinds of fees. \n NGOs have pointed out that Veikkaus managers’ salaries are tied to the firm’s profits as well as the growth of online gambling, while reducing problem gambling is not similarly rewarded. \n According to Peluuri’s Silvennoinen, pay incentives do not recognise corporate responsibility in any way, but focus on profit financial performance targets. \n Paatero also pledged to examine the system of performance incentives. \n \"It’s important to have performance targets to ensure that Veikkaus functions well, but it would be good to see whether or not they include responsibility for problem betting rather than euro-based results,\" she commented. \n Minister: Good reason for cabinet oversight \n The non-profit organisations also suggested that like Alko, ministerial oversight for Veikkaus could be transferred to the social and health affairs ministry. The prime minister’s office is currently responsible for monitoring the performance of the gambling firm. \n \"If we consider that Veikkaus’ main mission is to prevent problem gambling, it could raise the question of whether or not ownership steering should lie with the social affairs and health ministry, which is responsible for work combating the dangers of excessive gambling,\" Mikkonen pointed out. \n \"Alko is governed by the health ministry because the state-owned company has a specific function that is related to public health,\" he added. \n However the minister said that the merger of the three gambling organisations meant that specific ministries were still responsible for allocating Veikkaus profits. The Education and Culture Ministry determines funding distribution for sports, youth and culture programmes, while the health ministry handles allocations for social affairs and health, she noted. \n \"This is why it was seen as better that overall ownership steering would be in three places, because there is no justification for oversight to lie in the same functions that manage funding distribution,\" Paatero explained."}

I wouldn't pay much mind to what he says. Perhaps he wants people to react. Many across Europe are aware of his manner and his style; I don't think anyone has taken the bait.\" \n Orbán's comments were themselves a reaction to Finland's announcement that it would use its EU presidency period to move toward tying EU funding to each country's efficacy in rule of law. \n Orbán pointed to Finland's lack of a separate court for dealing with constitutional law matters, for instance, implying that Hungarians find it ridiculous when Finland calls attention to Hungary's enforcement of the rule of law. \n Finns Party sides with Orbán \n Meanwhile chair  Jussi Halla-aho  of the anti-immigration Finns Party said that Orbán's comments were legitimate. \n \"It's understandable that Hungary has criticised Finland in light of the fact that almost all of Finland's political parties as well as the government have been very aggressive about Hungary,\" Halla-aho said in early August. \n Niinistö said that contradictory opinions on foreign policy exist in Finland's Parliament, just as in parliaments elsewhere in Europe. \n \"It seems that Finns Party supporters see something they like in Orbán's politics, and they are expressing that,\" Niinistö said."}

The big question is where we'll find workers then,\" says Lintilä. \n Last year there were some 74,000 state employees, as well as many more working for local and regional authorities. \n Lintilä says that meeting this challenge will require both an increase in productivity and bringing more workers into Finland. The need for staff to fill vacant positions will be so urgent that even any increase in the birthrate would not suffice to solve the problem. \n In late July, Statistics Finland pegged the  unemployment rate  at 6.5 percent."}

{"text": "The Oulu-based paper Kaleva carries a story on  unequal distribution of EU unemployment subsidies in Finland . \n Analysis by the Uutissuomalainen news service found that in the current 2014-2020 funding period, jobless residents in the east and north of Finland received five times more EU structural fund programme money (9,688 euros per capita) than people without work in the west and south (1,875 euros per capita). The paper points out that Finland's east and north receive 70 percent of the total 1.3 billion euros in  European Union  funding, despite being home to only one-quarter of the population. \n Kaleva writes that municipal leaders in areas receiving less funding are lobbying for a change in the subsidy's distribution criteria. \n \"The criteria should in future not just be based on population, but also things like GDP, climate change and migration. Things like unemployment, youth unemployment, low education levels and social exclusion should also be factored in,\"  Jaakko Mikkola , municipal director of Kymenlaakso, tells the paper. The municipality of Kymenlaakso has one of Finland's highest unemployment rates, at 9.1 percent. \n NCP meets to plan opposition strategy \n Lahti-based Etelä-Suomen Sanomat reports on the  party leadership congress of Finland's conservative National Coalition Party , being held today and tomorrow in the southwest city of Turku. \n Currently  the second-largest party in Finland, the NCP meeting will begin this morning with an address by party chair  Petteri Orpo .

The app warns its customers to use the fast-moving bikes with caution and use a helmet. \n Traffic safety police superintendent  Konsta Arvelin  has responded to the new bike sharing scheme with apprehension about the danger they present, and with an important clarification: The fast electric bikes are categorised as mopeds, not bicycles. They might look like a bike, but closer inspection will reveal that they have small license plates, as they are registered in Finland as mopeds. \n \"The same traffic laws apply to them as apply to mopeds: the same blood alcohol content limitations and the same legal requirement to wear a helmet. They are banned from pavements and footpaths,\" he said. \n Arvelin adds that Finnish traffic laws also prohibit mopeds from using regular bike paths, with the exception of certain paths that have a special mention that mopeds are allowed. He says the only place the Bond bikes can be used is in the city is in traffic, on the right side of the road."}
{"text": "Vladimir Putin  arrives in Finland on Wednesday off the back of protests in Moscow over candidates for upcoming local elections, possibly  radioactive fallout  from a new cruise missile and  a meeting  with French President Emmanuel Macron this week at which the two compared notes on domestic protests. \n Putin’s summer visit to Finland has become something of a tradition, with the Russian leader heading west each year since 2016. In 2018 he even  met US President Donald Trump in Helsinki . \n Finland is rarely on the world stage, and so Ilta-Sanomat  basks  in the spotlight in an editorial replete with potshots at those who criticised Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  for meeting Putin in the aftermath of Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula. IS singles out Sweden for special mention, noting with satisfaction that Sweden and the other Nordics have ‘followed Niinistö’s example’ and met Putin anyway when the Nordic prime ministers assembled in Moscow this spring. \n Iltalehti goes for  a recap  of previous meetings, warning Niinistö of the Putin propensity to surprise. Helsingin Sanomat  has  an analysis piece that outlines in some depth the countries' relations and motivations, concluding that relations are ‘as good as they could be nowadays’. \n Running through the IS and HS pieces is the fact that Finland has always wanted to keep a line open to Moscow, as discussions with Russian leaders are important in achieving diplomatic goals. IS recalls that Niinistö told Sweden’s then-Foreign Minister  Karin Enström  in 2016 that Finland has a longer border with Russia than all other EU countries combined. So the consensus it is important to stay on good terms with the neighbours. \n Refugee polling \n Agrarian paper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus  publishes  a poll that suggests opinion is split on whether Finland should take in refugees attempting to reach Europe via the Mediterranean. The poll suggests that 47 percent said Finland should not accept such refugees, 37 percent said it should, while 16 percent declined to offer an opinion. \n The paper reports this as ‘nearly half oppose’ taking in refugees, and also divides the poll by party support to state that supporters of the Centre Party and Finns Party are most opposed to accepting these migrants. \n Over the summer Finland  said  it would accept 13 asylum seekers rescued from the Meditarranean. Parliament’s Grand Committee, which sets the parameters of Finnish EU policy, made clear this was a one-off gesture and not a policy shift--so the issue is likely to return to the political agenda soon. \n Marin’s four-day week  \n Should Finland look at cutting working hours? That’s the debate started by Transport and Communications Minister  Sanna Marin , who suggested that four days a week or six hours a day might be more appropriate than the current 40-hour week most workers perform. \n The Social Democrat’s idea did not get a warm reception from those on the right of Finnish politics or employers’ organisations. The  Juha Sipilä  government had pushed through an increase in working hours across the economy in order to improve competitiveness in export industries, so some commentators are asking whether this is a step backwards. \n That’s what Kauppalehti  thinks , asking if Finnish working life is so terrible after all. “A six-hour day is too much if every minute is full of anguish,” suggests the paper’s op-ed. Iltalehti, meanwhile,  takes  a more positive if slightly condescending view: Marin is right that technology could well reduce the number of working hours people perform, but 'completely wrong' in thinking this is something central government or labour organisations can mandate. \n That line, that Finland must change its tripartite labour negotiation system and move towards local pay bargaining, is a key talking point for employers’ organisations and one that may become more prominent now the union-backed SDP and Left Alliance are in government."}
{"text": "Finland's political parties are amenable to tighter restrictions on slot machines and gambling, according to a survey of political parties by Yle. \n The parties responded to a brief Yle survey on Wednesday after weeks of talks and  controversy over the ethics  of gambling monopoly Veikkaus' advertising practices. \n Some restrictions are already on the way, while a citizens initiative is also looking to slash the number of slot machines Veikkaus operates and restrict their locations. \n By 2022 gamblers in Finland will be required by law to digitally identify themselves to prove they are over 18 before accessing gambling services and slot machines. All parties except the populist Finns Party told Yle that they would be prepared to move that date forward in order to better monitor underage gaming. \n Minister of Local Government and Ownership Steering  Sirpa Paatero  from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) said she would be working to advance the identification timetable with Veikkaus this autumn. \n \"I'll be meeting with Veikkaus earlier than originally planned,\" Paatero said. \"We need to figure out how to technically implement this ID reform.\" \n Veikkaus estimated that bringing in the new ID rule in 2022 would mean the monopoly would see losses of anywhere between 17 million and 170 million euros. At the same time, however, costs from addiction and problem gaming would decrease. \n Gambling in Finland is a closed shop, with only Veikkaus officially allowed to operate and all Veikkaus profits used to fund culture, sports and social policy. That means politicians are both in charge of regulating Veikkaus and dependent on it for revenue to fund government spending. \n Removal from shops \n Yle asked parties whether gambling machines should be removed entirely from shops and kiosks and moved into dedicated arcades, as a  popular citizens' initiative  with more than  28,000 signatures  is fighting for. \n Of the official parties the Green Party, Left Alliance and Christian Democrats said they would support a ban on gambling machines in any spaces other than specified gaming halls. Unregistered political group Movement Now also answered that they would be for a public ban. \n Green Party chair and Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo  stuck to her hard line, saying that arcade gaming would be enough for non-addicted enthusiasts. \n \"Designating a certain facility for these games would most likely bring problematic playing habits down. Monitoring age limits and preventing severe drawbacks would be more effective,\" Ohisalo said. \n How many is too many? \n The Finnish government allows gambling monopoly Veikkaus to operate a maximum of 18,600 slot machines nationwide. The current number of machines is just 100 units below that. \n Five of the registered political parties – namely the SDP, Centre Party, Finns Party, National Coalition Party (NCP) and the Swedish People's Party – declined to comment on the appropriate number of machines. \n Many politicians and citizens are calling for the removal of gambling machines from shops. Marja Väänänen / Yle \n NCP chair  Petteri Orpo  said he would leave the number of gambling units to be determined by Veikkaus; but the Left Alliance holds a stricter stance. \n \"Studies show that low-income earners play these games the most, and lose the most money,\" said Left parliamentary group chair  Paavo Arhinmäki . \"We have to seriously consider reducing the number of these games and where they should be placed.\" \n Harry Harkimo  from Movement Now said the correct amount of machines would be however many can be realistically monitored within designated Veikkaus gaming halls. \n Panic button, user-specific limits \n One feature of the identification process is that players can set a maximum game limit, such as how many minutes or euros he or she is allowed to spend at the slots per day or month. \n Veikkaus online gambling now includes a prominent red \"panic button\" that players can press if they feel they cannot stop on their own. After the button is clicked, the game will no longer respond. \n Veikkaus promised in mid-August  to establish an ethics board  to control problem gaming. \n Elderly gamblers studied \n The Turku University Hospital announced that it is researching the brains of elderly gamblers. Pension-age women are one of the main problem gambling demographics, along with young adult men. \n The university study aims to develop a new medication that could help treat gambling addiction along with talk therapy. \n The challenge in medicating a gaming addiction is that the active ingredients need to be isolated from the brain's reward system, the university said. \n Statistics from the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) show that one in five people in Finland knows someone in their close contacts who gambles too much on Veikkaus machines."}
{"text": "Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  has described as \"worrying\" US plans to locate mid-range missiles in Europe and called for dialogue on the matter. Speaking during a joint press conference with his opposite number from Moscow  Vladimir Putin  on Wednesday, Niinistö said that the situation was not governed by any agreements, something that was especially troubling from the European perspective. \n \"We hope that talks aimed at [negotiating] a new agreement progress,\" Niinistö told journalists while referring to the US government’s decision to repudiate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF treaty), followed by a recent test of a medium-range cruise missile weeks after scuppering the decades-old deal with Russia. Analysts worry that the breakdown of the treaty could spawn a new nuclear arms race. \n Responding a question about the US missile test from Russian media, Putin said that he was disappointed by the development, which he said threatened security and breached the terms of the INF. Putin added that the test came too soon after the treaty was abandoned on 2 August and suggested that plans for the missile launch had been developed before the US tore up the treaty. \n The Russian president said he was concerned that modified Tomahawk marine missiles could be deployed in Romania and Poland, where NATO already has missile defence systems. \n \"We don’t know if the US will tell the Europeans where they are to be located. I agree with the Finnish president that we need dialogue. There is none now. We are ready to engage in dialogue with the US as well as with Europe,\" Putin said. \n Putin defends crackdown on protesters \n Host Niinistö trod a fine diplomatic line in response to a question from Yle’s  Sanna Uosikainen  about  the return of full Russian voting rights  in the Council of Europe and Moscow's perceived failure to comply with the Council’s mandate to honour human rights with respect to a crackdown on ongoing protests in Moscow. \n Niinistö said that it would be too easy to say that nothing similar happens in Finland. He noted that the Finnish government maintains active dialogue with civil society and that perhaps this is the reason. He also noted that membership in the Council of Europe is also important to Russian NGOs. \n Putin said that Russia respects human rights and noted that similar, sometimes more damaging demonstrations occur in other European countries. He explained that some local election candidates had been banned from standing for election because they had broken the law. He added that citizens have the right to demonstrate and noted that two protests had been lawful. However he said that if citizens did not have the required permit to demonstrate, then authorities would react the same as in any other European country. \n With respect to the Council of Europe, Putin said that if members were not satisfied with Russia, the country could pull out. But he noted that if Russia left, citizens would not have recourse to the European Court of Human Rights. \n Free electronic visas for EU citizens \n Both presidents praised the state of bilateral relations and Putin mentioned a number of initiatives where Russia and Finland would step up cooperation. Tourism was one such area where he said he hoped to see increased activity. He noted that roughly 3.5 million Russians visit Finland while one million Finns travel across the eastern border. \n He said that he hoped the number of EU visitors would rise with the introduction of free electronic visas for EU citizens hoping to visit St. Petersburg. He said work is underway to resolve issues relating to traveller identification. \n The presidents continued Putin's working day trip with a dinner at Finland's historic former fortress, Suomenlinna."}
{"text": "After touching down at the Helsinki Airport just shy of 4.30pm, Russian President  Vladimir Putin  finally met his host  Sauli Niinistö  at the Presidential Palace in downtown Helsinki just after 5.00pm, around two hours behind schedule. \n The heads exchanged pleasantries as their meeting began, with Putin saying via an interpreter that bilateral relations between the two countries had developed positively. \n The Russian President’s arrival in Finland resulted in a major security operation in which the route between the airport and the city centre was closed to allow his motorcade to proceed unfettered. \n Tourists and other members of the public were prohibited from the market square area near the Presidential Palace in downtown Helsinki. Laura Hyyti / Yle \n Helsinki police also said on Twitter that mass transit had been suspended on Mannerheimintie, while the market square opposite the official presidential residence had been cleared out and sealed off to the public, catching many tourists off-guard. \n Activists with a message for Putin \n Meanwhile NGOs and activists took advantage of Putin’s visit to the Finnish capital to send messages about the country’s human rights record, among other things. \n Human rights organisation Amnesty said it wanted to use the opportunity to raise the issue of free elections while Putin was in Helsinki. \n Amnesty protesters with a message for the Russian President, \"Putin, why are you afraid?\" Laura Hyyti / Yle \n Three young activists,  Jasmiina Salin ,  Iida Niva  and  Maria Kiiskinen  of the National Coalition Party’s youth wing said that they wanted to draw attention to concerns about democracy and minority rights in Russia. \n Meanwhile demonstrators representing another organisation, Fee Russia (Vapaa Venäjä) called for the arrest of the Russian president. \n Members of the National Coalition Party youth wing turned out to see Vladimir Putin.

{"text": "The country's most widely-read daily Helsingin Sanomat  discusses  Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö 's  meeting with Russian President  Vladimir Putin  yesterday in Helsinki. The National Defence University's Russian security expert  Katri Pynnönniemi  called Niinistö out for \"not questioning any of Putin's interpretations\" in his remarks. \n \"In my opinion, the most important thing was that Putin got all of his key talking points across. The thrust of his message matched Russia's long-term communication strategy which says that the US is making decisions over Europe's head, without consideration for the interests of its allies,\" she told the paper. \n She said President Niinistö could have challenged many of Putin's comments about the US' lack of communication with EU allies about its missile technology or US involvement in the European energy market – the latter of which conveniently painted the Russian-backed  Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline  as better-suited to European interests. \n \"He [Niinistö] surely could have said that the relationship between European and Nato countries and the US is a good one, or that Europeans still make their own, independent decisions,\" Pynnönniemi said. \n Another missed opportunity in her eyes concerned the subject of  a crackdown on demonstrations for free elections in Moscow . At this juncture, the Finnish President commented that it would be \"too easy to say that nothing similar happens in Finland\". \n \"Niinistö's criticism on this point was quite cloaked in that [...] there is no way you can compare the Finnish political system to what is happening in Russia right now,\" she told HS. \n Scrambled GPS and a downed police site \n Finland's tabloids talk about some of the knock-on effects the working visit had in Helsinki, in addition to the enhanced security presence and the  closure of streets, markets and harbours . Ilta-Sanomat reports that  GPS systems were apparently jammed  for about a half-hour around the time of Putin's  late arrival  at roughly 4:30 pm. \n Readers told IS that while Putin's motorcade was en route from the Helsinki Airport to the Presidential Palace, map services on their phones provided inaccurate location data. One man said he checked both his work and personal phone at his home in the Helsinki district of Viikki, only to have one show that he was sitting in the neighbouring city of Espoo and the other pinpoint his location in the district of Itäkeskus, in eastern Helsinki. He said that once Putin had arrived at his destination downtown, the services once again worked accurately. \n The incident is not the first of its kind in Finland, as air navigation authorities detected GPS jamming in  November 2018 during NATO exercises  in northern Finland and Norway. Norwegian authorities said at the time that their data indicated that the signal disruption was coming from Russia. \n Meanwhile tabloid Iltalehti reports that the  website of the Finnish Police crashed  on Wednesday evening while the Russian leader was in Helsinki, although \"there is no information yet if the disturbance is associated with Putin's visit\". \n Worried about the planet's future \n The Lahti-based newspaper Etelä-Suomen Sanomat reports on a  poll assessing climate change anxiety  in Finland's population. \n Some 27 percent of the over 2,000 respondents to the Sitra-commissioned poll said anxiety is \"very or somewhat good\" descriptor of their feelings about climate change. For the subset of people between the age of 15 and 30, this percentage rose to 38 percent, or more than one in three. \n Finns in the survey also reported feeling frustration, inadequacy, powerlessness and hope in the face of climate change. 60 percent said they have noted scepticism of global warming in their social circles, but less than half a percentage point said they have encountered outright climate change denial in Finland. \n The poll also inquired after people's  happiness levels . 55 percent said they felt very or somewhat happy, with about a quarter saying they were \"a little or not at all happy\"."}
{"text": "The youth wings of several political parties say pensions should be cut in the name of generational equality. \n The divide between young and old is raising debate among Finland's political youth groups. Young adults are questioning whether comfortable pensions will be out of their reach as they struggle to  find steady jobs  and  get a foot on the housing ladder . \n This summer the new government of PM  Antti Rinne   announced it would raise minimum pensions , a key election promise made by his Social Democratic Party (SDP). But that hasn't stopped the youth wings of the Greens, Centre — and even the SDP — from questioning the sustainability of the system as a whole. \n In Finland, any discussion pertaining to lowering pensions has long been seen as political suicide as retirees are the country's most active voters. \n Breaking a 'holy' promise \n Meddling with pension payments is an unfathomable idea to many in Finland, but the Green youths told Yle that many young people have lost their faith in the system. \n \"We're interpreting pensions from a 1960s legal perspective which sees retirements — a social benefit — as personal property,\" Green Youth chair  Amanda Pasanen  told Yle. \n \"We should radically minimise the cost of maintaining pensions for the system to remain sustainable and fair for future generations,\"  Sameli Sivonen , Pasanen's co-chair added. \n The Green Youths point out that the Finnish and Swedish systems rely on opposite approaches for shoring up money in the face of dwindling state coffers. While Finland has resorted to raising the level of statutory pension contributions from wage earners, Sweden's response has been to cut pensions. The Swedish system includes a 'brake' mechanism on index adjustments that triggers when the economy weakens. \n Suvi Mäkeläinen  of the Finnish Centre Party Youth has also come out in favour of a 'brake' mechanism, saying it would mainly affect those with large pensions and not retirees on the lower end of the scale. \n Vesa Rantahalvari  of the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) said that while slowing down index adjustments could be a good way to shore up funds, he said his organisation is primarily focused on raising Finland's  falling birthrate , increasing  work-based immigration  and  improving employment  overall. \n Meanwhile  Sinikka Näätsaari  who heads pension policy matters at the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) pointed out that  recent retirement age hikes  have increased the pool of people paying into the system to ease the state's burden. \n But  Mikkel Näkkäläjärvi  of the SDP's youth organisation is not convinced that increasing the contribution base will be enough. \n \"People born during or after the 1970s are definitely not winners in the system,\" he said. \"The next pension reform will have to address generational equality.\""}
{"text": "From across the political spectrum, Finnish politicians voiced concern over the wildfires raging the Amazon rainforests of Brazil. \n Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  called the fires \"a threat to our whole planet, not just to Brazil or South America.\" \n \"When it comes to climate change, the situation is extremely serious and we need to act immediately,\" he said in a statement on Friday, pledging to discuss the situation within the European Council. \n \"We must find out whether the Europeans have something to offer to Brazil to help prevent this kind of fires in the future. It goes without saying that in terms of climate change the world cannot sustain such fires...I am truly worried about the attitude Brazil seems to have adopted right now regarding its own forests. Brazil should do all it takes to end the fires that are a danger to our whole civilisation,\" he added. \n The Amazon produces an estimated one fifth of the world's oxygen, making it a crucial player in efforts to limit climate change. \n Brazilian beef ban? \n Finland, which holds the EU Council presidency, said the EU should consider banning Brazilian beef in response to the devastation caused by the fires, widely attributed to the clearing of land for farming of soybeans and beef. \n “Finance Minister  Mika Lintilä  condemns the destruction of Amazon rainforests and proposes that the EU and Finland urgently look into the option of banning the import of Brazilian beef,” he said in a statement released in Finnish only on Friday afternoon. \n He added that he was \"prepared to raise the issue for discussion with my EU finance minister colleagues when they arrive in Helsinki in September if progress is not made before that,\" he said. \n \"We should think broadly about various measures through which we could bring pressure in this acute situation, both trade policy measures and certainly also diplomatic means. And to think together at the EU level as well, and for that reason of course we're calling the EU together for a meeting,\" Environment Minister  Krista Mikkonen  told Yle on Friday. \n Meetings this weekend \n European Commission VP  Jyrki Katainen  told the daily Helsingin Sanomat that he planned to find out on Friday what kinds of measures the EU could implement. According to the paper, he plans to call an emergency meeting of the Commission to discuss the issue on Saturday morning. \n Meanwhile French President  Emmanuel Macron  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  say the crisis which must be discussed at the G7 summit that begins in France on Saturday. \n Petteri Orpo , chair of Finland's opposition National Coalition Party, posted a tweet saying that \"the destruction of the Amazon rainforests must stop. The EU must take its place at the forefront of the work against climate change and condemn Brazil's actions. This madness threatens the world's valuable carbon sinks.\" \n Protests and coffee beans \n Meanwhile as in several other capitals, the climate group Extinction Rebellion organised a small demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy in Helsinki's Kaivopuisto district on Friday morning. \n Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) says its satellite data shows an 85 percent increase in wildfires compared to the same period of last year. \n Environmental NGOs says that President  Jair Bolsonaro , a long time climate change denier, has encouraged clearing activities, while he has accused them of lighting the fires themselves. On Thursday, he conceded that farmers could be behind the fires. \n Bolsonaro has repeatedly called for opening the Amazon to business interests, to allow mining, agricultural and logging companies to exploit its natural resources. \n While Brazil is Finland's largest trading partner in South America, trade between the two countries is relatively small, accounting for less than one percent of Finnish imports. Bilateral trade totalled less than a billion euros last year. \n Finland mainly imports pulp and food products from Brazil – including less than five million euros' worth each of beef and soybeans annually, along with some 70 million euros' worth of coffee beans."}

At the last election the party received 3.9 percent of the vote. \n In Oulu she said that the parliamentary arithmetic would allow for a more conservative government to be formed if the Centre Party switched sides. \n “Together with the Centre Party the three opposition parties could form a majority government supported by 113 MPs,” said Essayah. “This is surely noted in government meetings and government parties’ offices.” \n The current government led by SDP chair  Antti Rinne  and composed of the Left Alliance, SDP, Swedish People’s Party and Centre Party has the support of 117 MPs. \n Story continues after photo \n Tiina Kokko / Yle \n Essayah also took the opportunity to comment on the  ongoing police investigation  into former leader  Päivi Räsänen  over comments in June criticizing Pride week, and particularly the Finnish Lutheran church’s participation in it. \n “As a party we don’t handle church business, but Päivi has done so in her role [as a member of the church],” said Essayah. “She has exercised her freedom of speech and her freedom of conviction, which has traditionally been very broad in Finland and that’s the viewpoint from which she has acted.” \n “We have wanted to emphasise the importance of freedom of religion in Finnish society,” said Essayah. “For example if you think about marriage, it is important to us that parishes can themselves decide on their understanding of marriage based among other things on who can marry and who cannot. \n Finland passed a law allowing same-sex marriage in 2015, and the law took effect in 2017. The Lutheran Church, however, still holds that marriage is between a man and a woman and does not recognize gay marriage, although some priests have blessed gay unions."}
{"text": "Minister of Agriculture and Forestry  Jari Leppä  is calling for Finland to stop importing soybeans within the next five years. \n In a blog post on his personal website on Tuesday, the Centre Party MP argued that imported soybean meal would be unnecessary if domestic production of broad beans (also known as fava beans) were to be expanded to 80,000 hectares,  up from 22,000 hectares  (data from 2017). \n \"This expanded amount would account for about four percent of Finland's farmland,\" Leppä said. A total of 7 percent of Finland's land mass is used for farming. \n Leppä's special adviser  Satu Haapaniemi  told Yle that the minister's aim is to primarily stop using soy in Finland as animal fodder; originally Leppä did not differentiate between the different uses of the soy bean. \n Late on Tuesday he specified that the use of soy for human consumption should also be curbed. \n \"There are all sorts of different non-animal foods these days. We are hoping for innovations that could replace soy in all uses as far as possible. But the main message here is the animal feed,\" Leppä said. \n Ecology first \n In his original blog post Leppä notes that imports of soy for livestock feed have risen significantly in the past decade. Most of it comes from the US as well as Brazil, whose leadership recently came under international criticism for encouraging the razing of rainforests for new farmlands. \n Leppä asserts that Brazilian soybeans do not meet accountability criteria or Finland's target of carbon neutrality by 2035. Therefore he argues that Finland should be essentially soy-free by 2025. \n He notes that soy is an important source of protein for animal feed, but that the Finnish feed industry has worked hard to replace it with domestic raw materials such as oats, peas and rapeseed. \n Soy still fed to pigs and chickens \n Finnish milk and beef production is already nearly soy-free, says Leppä, who is a long-time beef and dairy farmer himself. \n In pork production, soy accounts for about six percent of fodder,  Marjukka Manninen , an expert at the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK), told the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat last week. Meanwhile about 15 percent of feed for broiler chickens comes from soy, with the rest mostly domestic grains. \n \"This is the right direction when we think about climate change as well as changing food trends. We have very great potential in this protein-rich domestic crops,\" Leppä writes. \n He says it is realistic that for instance 80,000 hectares of broad bean cultivation could replace all imports of soybean meal, noting that this would be less than four percent of Finland's cultivated land. \n One of the few holdovers from the previous Centre-led cabinet, Leppä has been Minister of Agriculture and Forestry since May 2017. He has been a beef and dairy farmer in South Savo since 1980 and an MP since 1999, earning the dubious distinction of being the MP with the highest earnings from agricultural subsidies for several years running, to the tune of 120,000 euros in 2016."}

But today the message came that that initiative had been deferred. It tells me that Johnson’s actions are very contradictory,\" Rinne said on Wednesday, adding that the situation now looks worse than one day earlier. \n \"It definitely increases the risk of a no-deal Brexit,\" he added. \n Analysts believe that if the UK crashes out of the EU, it would complicate movement between Britain and mainland Europe. It could also affect the economy and make the availability of medicines problematic. \n Given Finland’s presidency of the EU Council, Rinne said he has offered his assistance in ensuring that the UK does not leave the EU without a deal. However Rinne said he now has to wait and see. \n \"At the moment the situation seems chaotic. We are awaiting clarification from the UK [to see] if we can somehow assist,\" he added. \n Haavisto: No-deal Brexit could bring many surprises \n Meanwhile Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  offered comments on the current situation from a Greens parliamentary group meeting in Hämeenlinna. \n \"Of course from Finland’s perspective it’s important that Brexit is orderly, however it happens.

On Thursday Posti announced a new pay structure for 700 packaging and e-commerce workers that would reduce their base salaries while providing incentive pay for productivity, customer service and work quality. The new system is due to begin in November. \n The postal workers’ union PAU said the new pay structure would effectively gouge the affected employees’ pay by an average of 30 percent, and in some cases up to 50 percent. \n The average monthly salary of a postal worker is 2,200 euros. A 30-percent salary reduction would mean losing 660 euros every month.

As a state-owned company, Posti pays dividends to its sole shareholder, the state. Earlier this year the company reported  a slight increase in second-quarter revenues  despite slowing mail volumes. \n \"It’s always possible to discuss the level of dividends [paid] and in this case as well it can be discussed with the company,\" Paatero said in the Demokraatti interview in response to Taavitsenainen’s suggestion. \n On Friday business weekly Talouselämä reported that in four years, Posti chief executive  Heikki Malinen ’s annual salary including bonuses had risen by 65 percent to 990,000 euros. That amounts to a monthly pay packet of about 82,500 euros. \n The business paper also noted that the management team’s pay had also increased significantly during the same period. Paatero said that it would be possible to discuss bonuses paid to top management, including in what situations and on what basis they are distributed. \n PAU: Management salaries untouchable \n Meanwhile PAU chair  Heidi Nieminen  told Yle that to her ears, Malinen’s pay sounded generous. However she said it is not for her to condemn other people’s salaries, regardless of how large they might be. \n She added that what she could not understand is that some in Posti believe that the lowest-paid workers are earning too much and should have their wages lowered 30 percent. \n The union leader said she would like to see Posti’s efforts to reduce costs reflected in measures that affect others apart from regular or supervisory staff. \n She pointed out that during employee-employer negotiations last spring to agree on cost reduction measures, it appeared that while the company was ready to cut spending on staff, management was not prepared to similar savings measures. \n \"In the negotiations we raised [the question that] if we start saving on employment contract spending, would the management commit to ensuring that the resulting savings would not result in bigger bonuses for managers. Posti told us that they could not commit to that and that it could not be discussed in the talks,\" Nieminen disclosed. \n Yle was unable to reach Posti board chair  Markku Pohjola  for comment on Friday. \n Edit: Updated at 2.13pm to remove reference to Posti as a stock-listed company."}
{"text": "The prospect of a change of leadership within the agrarian Centre Party has done little to boost support for the party, according to the latest poll by national broadcaster Yle. The survey of voter approval shows backing for the Centre led by interim chair and former Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä , dipping below 12 percent of support last month. \n Meanwhile the nationalist opposition Finns Party was the country's most popular in August, according to the poll. Some 20.6 percent of respondents said they support the Finns Party, giving the populists a three-percentage-point lead over the second-most popular, the centre-right National Coalition Party (17.4%), which came in second place, followed by Prime Minister  Antti Rinne 's Social Democratic Party (SDP), which received support from 16.9 percent of respondents. \n Tough times ahead for new Centre leader \n The Centre Party, which led the previous three-party administration, suffered severe losses in April's parliamentary elections and in Yle's August poll, support for the party fell by more than two percentage points to below 12 percent. \n After the election, former-PM Sipilä  claimed responsibility  for the party's losses and stepped down as chair. In August, the two candidates duelling for that post - economic affairs minister  Katri Kulmuni  and defence minister  Antti Kaikkonen  travelled around the country making their cases to lead the party. \n The new party leader will be chosen this Saturday at an annual congress in Kouvola, in southeast Finland. \n The Centre holds the Minister of Finance's portfolio, but that has not appeared to help the party's approval ratings. Instead the post may be more of a burden as prospects for economic growth weaken and possible future tax increases or spending cuts loom. \n Big issues ahead for SDP \n After a June dip in ratings, the SDP saw a small uptick in the latest poll. At the same time the Greens' support fell after a summertime boost, as did the Left Alliance's figures. \n Finland's EU presidency has dominated the first months of Rinne's administration, but the big questions on the economy and employment are directly ahead in early autumn. \n The speed at which Rinne and Minister of Local Government and Ownership Steering,  Sirpa Paatero , reacted to recent outrage over national mail carrier  Posti's salary policies  is also possibly a sign of increasing pressure ahead of challenging job market talks in the autumn. \n The SDP (polling at 16.9 percent support) has yet to climb back to its post-parliamentary election approval rating of 17.7 percent. \n Rinne in opposition cross hairs \n Analysts say the NCP, polling in second place, has a learning curve ahead. The party has not been in the opposition for 12 years, and there are only a few MPs who would even remember the party line from those days. \n NCP chair  Petteri Orpo  was first elected to Parliament in 2007, while the parliamentary group's chair  Kai Mykkänen  has been an MP for only two terms. The party is taking aim at Rinne's economic and employment policies, and is even now preparing its first interpellation on the new administration's employment strategy after the mid-September budget session. \n Meanwhile, Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  has returned as an MP following five years as an MEP. Halla-aho resigned as chair of the Administration Committee in 2012 after contesting a conviction for hate speech. He declined a position as head of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, saying it would interfere with his Finns party chairmanship. \n Out of the 2,440 respondents to the survey, a total of 1,683 people divulged their party affiliation. The margin of error in the survey, carried out by pollster Taloustutkimus, was two percentage points in either direction."}

And we don't know what is happening there,\" he replied. \n \"It seems very obvious that we are not yet in Brexit with agreement. And we have here in Finland and also in the European Union level done work that we can manage that kind of situation also. And that means that we are ready for that kind of Brexit also. I hope that they can reach a situation where this can be solved so that there is no mess, but it seems not possible now,\" Rinne said in English. \n \"Open to discussing any initiative\" \n Replying in Italian, Sassoli said that \"there is a lot of unity between the 27 member states to defend the deal, which we believe is the best deal possible. Of course we're open to discussing any initiative that may come forward.\" \n \"It's painful for us if the UK leaves the EU but if they're going to leave without a deal, then someone has to take responsibility for that and for the fact that in Ireland quite naturally a border will have to be put up. There is unity on the deal that we found. However we are open to hearing further proposals that may be put on the table,\" Sassoli added. \n In response, Rinne said: \"We're not ready to open this agreement we have negotiated between Britain and European Union.\" \n Climate focus in talks \n The two also returned several times to the issue of climate and emissions reductions, which Finland has set as the main theme of its European Council Presidency. \n \"We have a broad consensus on the need to [have] a strong emphasis on climate actions in the EU budget. I want to highlight the EU global climate leadership course for committing to climate neutrality by 2050,\" Rinne said. \n Sassoli noted that \"there are urgencies in that the general public is calling for major change when it comes to climate policy. We're going to do more. And we are going to have to be able to rise to the challenge of the threat that it poses,\" he said. \n \"The parliament has indicated a number of very ambitious objectives. A 55-percent cut in CO2 emissions is of course a huge challenge and so we'd very much like to see how the Commission intends to move forward with that...we've put our faith in these objectives and we hope that they will be kept too.\" \n Climate, sustainable growth and the EU budget were the main topics earlier on Friday morning when Rinne and Sassoli met with the chairs of the European Parliament’s political groups and ministers from Rinne's centre-left cabinet. \n Sassoli, a centre-left MEP since 2009, was elected as President of the European Parliament in early July, at the same time as Finland took over the six-month rotating presidency."}

He has been under fire in recent weeks over his generous remuneration in a time when the company is trying to slash jobs and wages. \n The paper reports that the country club expenditure caused consternation within Posti, as it came just when the firm was launching redundancy talks that led to more than 300 employees losing their jobs. \n \"It doesn't sound very good\" \n \"One has to admit that it doesn't sound very good,\" Paatero said on Friday in Parliament. \n Paatero questioned spending on golf fees while simultaneously carrying on tough co-determination negotiations and job cuts. She said that she would not be able to analyse management golf benefits on Friday, but that they would be included in an overall re-evaluation of executive remuneration at the state-owned firm. \n \"It's essential that I get information and ask the company what this is all about,\" she said. \n Posti's revenue has slumped in recent years as many consumers opt for electronic versions instead of having letters and newspapers delivered to their mailboxes, and it faces more competition for package deliveries. \n On Tuesday, Paatero announced that after talks with Posti, it agreed to reconsider management salaries, bonuses and benefits, and to  suspend a plan  to force some workers to accept much weaker working contracts. The postal union, which estimated that would have cut their wages by 30-50 percent, then agreed to cut short a strike. \n 3 shares at posh Espoo club \n According to Iltalehti, Posti previously owned three membership shares in another prestigious golf club, Master Golf on Lake Bodom in northern Espoo. However the firm sold these when it bought the Sarfvik share. Posti told the paper that it sold the Master Golf shares because it was difficult to reserve tee times at the venue. \n Paatero, a long-time parliamentarian from Prime Minister  Antti Rinne 's Social Democratic Party, took over as Minister of Local Government and Ownership Steering in June. This week she also announced changes to the board of directors of the  state-owned gambling agency Veikkaus  amid claims that it has failed to tackle problem gambling."}

Close to half answered that they were very satisfied with his performance. \n Sauli Niinistö  has seen public support for his presidency rise steadily since he was  first elected  president in 2012. The former conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) chair and finance minister was re-elected for a second six-year term in 2018 after a  landslide vote . \n The poll indicates that Niinistö enjoys the support of the Finnish public across party lines. In fact, 63 percent of respondents who identified as Social Democratic Party supporters felt Niinistö was doing a very good job, followed by 62 percent of Centre Party adherents, and 59 percent of NCP supporters. \n Just three percent of the 1,005 people participating in the poll gave the president a \"somewhat or very poor\" grade.

{"text": "Delegates to an extraordinary meeting of Finland's Centre Party have elected  Katri Kulmuni  has their new party chair. Kulmuni defeated the only other candidate for the position, defence minister  Antti Kaikkonen , by gaining 1,092 votes compared to Kaikkonen's 829. She takes over the reins of the party from  Juha Sipilä , who decided to step down from the position after the party was soundly defeated in April's general elections. \n Kulmuni said told the gathered crowd that the work would start now to change the agrarian-backed Centre Party from a \"10 percent party to a 20 percent party\". She will serve as the Centre Party chair until Sipilä's term would have ended in the summer of 2020, when the party congress was originally set to choose a leader. \n Before the vote, MP  Joonas Könttä  from the central Finland city of Jyväskylä explained why he was planning to support Kulmuni as the party's next leader. \n \"The Centre Party looks towards the future from a difficult position, and I believe that Katri is the best choice for us moving forward. She is modern, very competent, and a very centrist choice. I think she also appeals to new people,\" he said. \n Sipilä's farewell address focused on achievements \n Outgoing chair Juha Sipilä spoke to the assembly, pointing out that his austerity-minded government coalition created 14,000 new jobs during his term in office. He told the gathered delegates that he would have liked to continue as the party chair, but the Centre Party's  trouncing at the ballot box  this spring – resulting in the loss of 18 parliamentary seats – made it clear to him that it was best to step down. \n Kulmuni will have her work cut out for her, as support for the party fell to 13.8 percent in the last election, putting the once-on-top Centre Party in fourth position behind the nationalist Finns Party, the centre-right National Coalition Party and the left-leaning Social Democrats. Yle's  latest assessment of political allegiances in September  suggests that support has fallen even further, to 11.6 percent of the population. \n The next elections in Finland won't be until the municipal elections scheduled for spring 2021.

{"text": "Jutta Urpilainen , a former finance minister in the  Jyrki Katainen  administration, has been nominated for a European Commission post as commissioner responsible for international partnerships. The portfolio is a new position created by EU Commission president-designate  Ursula von der Leyen . \n Commenting on the appointment, Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  said that Urpilainen’s position is \"extremely important in the current global situation.\" \n \"In a situation in which a rule-based world is being challenged, trade wars are ongoing and when peace must be brokered, then I think this portfolio is extremely important. It is also important from an economic perspective,\" Rinne noted. \n Finland was vying for an influential post in development, training or defence and Rinne discussed the prospects with von der Leyen over the weekend. \n \"When I heard about the details of the position I was very satisfied. It’s right for Jutta and for Finland,\" the PM added. \n Rime said that he was not disappointed that the role of economy commissioner went to the Italian  Paolo Gentiloni  and described the line-up of prospective commissioners as balanced. \n Focus on Africa \n Urpilainen was the first female chair of the Social Democratic Party, which she led from 2008 to 2014 before relinquishing her role as finance minister when she was toppled from the chairmanship by current party leader Rinne. Urpilainen told Yle that she was pleased with the nomination. \n \"I am very satisfied with the assignment. It involves both economic and external relations,\" she remarked, adding that she would leave it to others to assess the prestige of the post. \n \"I have the Commission’s largest division – foreign relations – at my disposal. As an administrative arm it is the third largest in the EU budget. The main focus is development issues, in other words where we can support reaching sustainable development goals by the year 2030,\" she commented. \n The former school teacher said that developing a new \"Africa strategy\" would be an important part of her role. \n \"We must build a new strategic partnership with Africa in which the private sector is also actively involved in creating investments, jobs and permanent wellbeing.\" \n The commissioner-in-waiting said that the international partnerships role will tackle major generational issues such as climate change, new security threats, the growth of inequality and a crisis of democracy. She noted that the challenge of immigration was that EU member states had not been able to implement agreed measures. \n \"What is essential is that we address the root causes of immigration and create a situation where people do not see their only hope as leaving their home countries,\" she declared. \n New Commission portfolio \n Commission president-designate Ursula von der Leyen said that it is important for the EU to invest in neighbouring territories. She referred to Urpilainen’s work as finance minister, as a member of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee and as a special peace envoy, a role that she performed between 2017 and 2019 during her term as an SDP MP. At the time she visited countries such as Ethiopia. \n The current EU Commission doesn’t have a separate portfolio for international partnerships and the new role will place special emphasis on relations with Africa. According to von der Leyen, one aspect Urpilainen’s mission will be to broker partnership agreements with migrants’ countries of origin as well as transit countries as part of the new Africa strategy she will design. \n \"By this von der Leyen is sending the message that there is a crucial connection between Africa and Europe. To influence migration so that it’s on a sustainable level in the future we must be able to improve living conditions in countries of origin,\" Urpilainen declared. \n The incoming commissioner said that this approach would include conflict resolution as well as investment and job creation. \n Von der Leyen noted that a separate portfolio with responsibility for Africa had been proposed at some point, but it had been set aside because the African Union, an organisation comprising 55 continental member states, would have seen it as a problem. \n The commissioner nominees will next face scrutiny by the relevant committees of the European Parliament before the body greenlights the appointments. Once that happens, the European Council will formally appoint the next European Commission, including the president (von der Leyen) as well as all of the vice presidents and commissioners."}
{"text": "When the Centre Party elected  Katri Kulmuni   as its new leader last weekend , Finnish political history turned a new page: now a majority of party chairs are women. Of the eight parties in Parliament, five have female leaders. \n On Tuesday yet another glass ceiling was shattered as  Jutta Urpilainen  became the first Finnish woman to be  an official nominee to the European Commission . She was previously the first woman to serve as finance minister and to lead the Social Democratic Party (SDP). \n Women's progress to the top level of Finnish politics has been slow. In 1907 Finland became one of the world's first countries to allow women in Parliament, electing 19 female MPs that year, while Finland was still a Grand Duchy under the Russian Tsar. The country gained independence a decade later but it was not until the 1990s that women began to hold powerful political positions. \n Still, female progress in politics has been relatively fast compared to that in the business sector, for instance, according to  Ilkka Ruostetsaari , professor of politics at the University of Tampere. \n \"Women form a larger share of the political elite than any other elite groups. Politics has been a more open channel for women to rise,\" he tells Yle. \n Women are still under-represented in upper-level corporate management, Ruostetsaari notes. And employment roles are still often split by gender. \n Glass ceiling breakers Finnish female firsts Jutta Urpilainen (SDP): European Commissioner-designate 2019 -, Finance Minister 2011-14, SDP chair 2008-14 Tarja Halonen (SDP): President 2000-12, Foreign Minister 1995-2000 Anneli Jäätteenmäki (Centre): Prime Minister April-June 2003, Centre chair 2002-03 Riitta Uosukainen (NCP): Speaker of Parliament 1994 - 2003 Elisabeth Rehn (SPP): Defence Minister 1990-94 Heidi Hautala (Greens): Parliamentary group chair 1987-91 Helvi Sipilä (Lib): Presidential candidate 1982, UN Assistant Secretary-General 1972-1980 Miina Sillanpää (SDP): Government minister 1926-27 Sirkka Hämäläinen: Bank of Finland Governor 1992-98 Riitta Prusti (SDP): labour union leader (TVK) So far no women have served as: Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces Chair of any employers' confederation Archbishop of either state-supported church \n \"We still have a lot of sectors in working life that are dominated by either men or women. So there is certainly plenty of work to be done to advance equality,\" Kulmuni says. \n NCP and Finns parties stick to male leaders \n All five female chairs have been elected by party members at large. Besides Kulmuni, the include three ministers in the current cabinet: Minister of Justice  Anna-Maja Henriksson  of the Swedish People's Party, Education Minister  Li Andersson  of the Left Alliance and Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo  of the Greens.  Sari Essayah  is chair of the small opposition Christian Democrats. \n Meanwhile the two main opposition parties are the only ones that have never had female leaders: the nationalist Finns Party and the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP). \n \"Of course different issues make it onto the agenda when people with very different backgrounds make it into Parliament,\" says Ohisalo. She points out that people with disabilities, for instance, are still under-represented in decision-making processes. \n According to Andersson, \"there is still work to be done on traditional equality issues such as domestic violence, segregated workplaces, wage equality and family leave.\" \n Centre boasts several firsts \n Ohisalo's and Andersson's parties, the Greens and the Left Alliance, have had several female leaders, as has the Centre. \n \"It's particularly positive that Kulmuni has also become a party chair. The Centre has had female leaders, although from a gender perspective it is a more conservative party,\" says  Johanna Kantola , professor of gender studies at the University of Tampere. \n Indeed, the Centre was the first of the traditional 'big three' parties to have a woman as leader when  Anneli Jäätteenmäki  took over in 2002. She went on to become the first female prime minister, but her term was cut short by a scandal over leaked documents after just two months. The only other female PM, the Centre's  Mari Kiviniemi , only held office for a year. \n In 2007, Centre prime minister  Matti Vanhanen 's second cabinet became Finland's  first with a female majority . The current government, led by SDP chair  Antti Rinne , includes 11 women and eight men. \n Three of the parties in the five-party coalition are led by women under the age of 35. Kantola says this a positive development as it shatters and expands Finns' images of young women. \n The share of women in Parliament has risen from 9.5 percent in 1907 to 47 percent in the current legislature, elected in April. \n \"But as long as there are not as many women as men in Parliament, we still have work to do,\" says Kulmuni."}

Several firms are involved in the international, Russian-led project, including Finnish energy company Fortum. \n \"Nord Stream 2 is a threat to all of Europe,\" Zelensky said he told the Finnish president, noting that it is important to Ukraine that its international partners do not falter in implementing sanctions against Russia. \n Meanwhile, Niinistö said he had brought greetings to Ukraine from the Finnish people. \n \"We support you and are in solidarity,\" Niinistö said. \n On Tuesday, the supreme court of the EU, the European Court of Justice overruled a decision to permit Russian energy firm Gazprom to deliver more gas via the Opal gas line - which connects with the Nord Stream line - to Germany, according Reuters news service. \n The ruling was controversial in Poland and some eastern European countries, because Gazprom plans to sidestep legacy pipelines through Poland and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Germany defended the project, as Poland claimed that the scheme would disrupt gas supplies to the region. \n Finland  issued its final regional permit  for the Russia-Germany pipeline in April. \n Broad talks on eastern Ukraine crisis \n The presidents also discussed the crisis in eastern Ukraine, which has continued for the past five years. \n Zelensky said he has been working toward a resolution of the situation but fell short of making promises on reaching positive results. \n The Ukrainian president reiterated his support for the Normandy Four - also known as the Normandy contact group - a diplomatic body consisting of high-level representatives from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, which aims to end the eastern Ukraine war. \n Zelensky also mentioned the importance of the Minsk Protocol, in which Ukraine and Russia agreed to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine in September 2014. The agreement called for a ceasefire in the region but the truce has been violated on a nearly daily basis. \n Niinistö said that since the regional conflict began in February 2014, Finland has offered assistance in establishing contacts with both the countries and is still prepared to do so. \n The Finnish president also noted that he recently met with  Russian  and  French  leaders, saying that it was an honour to also meet Ukraine's new leader. \n The presidents of both countries praised the cooperation between Finland and Ukraine. Zelensky, who has been president since May, expressed satisfaction with investments, energy as well as environmental projects and cooperation in education which Finland has provided. \n On Friday, the second day of his visit to Ukraine, Niinistö is scheduled to speak to attendees at the Yalta European Strategy (Yes) Annual Meeting in Kiev. \n This year the Yes forum invited more than 400 politicians, diplomats and dignitaries from 26 countries to discuss issues on the topic of governance for happiness and the challenges of such efforts."}

The council decided on the estimated cost at which the city would lease and sell the site to the builders on Thursday. \n Reservations from the Left Alliance \n Some council members, primarily from the Left Alliance, have expressed concerns about the priority of the decisions made. \"The order in which the decisions were made seems unusual. The question of financing arose before anything else was decided,\"  Anna Vuorjoki , a council member representing the Left Alliance, said. \n \"I believe that we should first think about whether we want the entire hall, and what kind of hall we want. Only then should we decide what price we could sell the site for,\" she added, recommending that the proposal should be revisited from the beginning. \n Paavo Arhinmäki , another council member from the Left Alliance, said that it seemed strange that the council had already set a price even before the layout for the garden hall had been discussed. \n \"It is far too early to set the terms of the transfer.

During that time his group received about 180,000 euros in donations, of which only 20,000 euros were in return for a product. \n The group distributed buttons and bracelets in exchange for donations of 10-25 euros.

Funding decisions will determine how ambitiously defence cooperation, for instance, can be advanced. \n At their October 17-18 summit in Brussels, the member states are expected to decide on formally opening membership negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania. They were unable to reach unanimity on the question in June. \n Rinne also plans to travel soon to Hungary to meet with his counterpart  Viktor Orbán , who over the summer criticised Finland in response to pressure over his right-wing government's implementation of the rule of law. \n From France to Satakunta \n On Monday Rinne will visit Rauma on Finland's southwest coast.

This will lead to the state becoming more indebted,\" conservative National Coalition Party chair  Petteri Orpo  told Yle. \n Orpo also slammed the government’s employment-boosting measures such as  wage subsidy programmes  as having little impact. \n Opposition Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho , while also critical of the state’s plans to sell off assets to shore up funds, praised the cabinet’s plans to target a 200-million-euro tax break on low- and middle-income earners. \n Christian Democrat leader  Sari Essayah  meanwhile took to Twitter to criticise the budget plans for \"eroding consumers' purchasing power.\" \n \"Stimulus budget\" \n \"Overall, this was a stimulus budget that added more expenditures than it raised taxes. I would have saved the stimulus measures for when there’s a recession on the horizon,\"  Ilkka Kaukoranta , chief economist with the blue-collar labour confederation SAK, told Yle’s morning television show on Wednesday. \n He also welcomed the government’s commitment to attracting more work-based immigration. \n “It was a smart decision to ease labour migration [into Finland]. The idea was to streamline the process and shorten waiting periods,” he added. \n The Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) said it was pleased with the 100 million euros in additional funding the government has earmarked for environmental protection. \n FANC did, however, slam the government’s  policies on peat energy , saying high-emission peat should be taxed in the same way as fossil fuels."}

The party split in 2017  when Halla-aho was elected chair , with co-founder  Timo Soini  and other more moderate party leaders leaving to form an ill-fated new party. \n Halla-aho's Finns Party came close to winning April's parliamentary election, earning just one seat fewer in the new parliament than the Social Democrats."}
{"text": "An Yle survey of MPs has found growing support for the legalisation of snus sales in Finland. \n Finnish politicians are becoming more open to legalising snus, an orally-ingested tobacco product that’s banned everywhere in the EU except Sweden. \n The Swedish People’s Party has previously supported legalising snus in Finland. But Yle's poll now finds that support for the measure spans the political spectrum. \n Residents can legally import up to 1kg of snus a day for personal use. However the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has proposed  lowering this allowance to 100 grams . Last year, the Finnish Medical Association (FMA) said the import of snus  should be banned altogether . \n Students reselling old snus \n Left Alliance MP  Merja Kyllönen  told Yle that while she’s not a fan of the substance, she wants the government to seek an EU exemption to the snus sales ban in Finland. \n \"We’re not able to manage this problem. The black market is growing and more young people are using snus. I’ve even heard from teachers that students are reselling used snus,” Kyllönen explained. \n Proponents claim legalising snus sales would not only bring in taxes but also information on sellers and users. \n Finns Party MP  Juha Mäenpää  recently proposed legalising snus, drawing on figures from 2013 estimating that illegally imported snus would earn the state 40 million euros in taxes annually if sold in Finland legally. \n Approaching the issue from a substance abuse perspective,  Atte Harjanne  of the Greens said he supported legalisation as it would give health officials more control from a drug policy standpoint. \n In total, 49 MPs responded to Yle’s survey on whether Finland should legalise the sale and import of snus. Eighteen came out in favour of legalisation, 24 were against the idea and seven parliamentarians could not provide an answer either way. \n Even if Finland's legislature opted to legalise snus, changing EU policy would be an uphill battle. \n Kyllönen said that despite low odds of change happening anytime soon, she wants to call Sweden out as it is the only EU country allowed to sell snus within its borders. \n \"How could Sweden get an exemption for a commercial activity happening within its borders that's causing problems in Finland?” Kyllönen asked. \n Health experts: No to legalisation \n The Finnish Association for Substance Abuse Prevention (EHYT) pointed out that Finland has committed to making the country  smoke-free by the year 2030 —a goal covering all nicotine products. \n \"Legalising snus doesn't support this goal,\" said  Hanne Munter  of EHYT. \n She told Yle that the snus industry has successfully  marketed the substance to young people, including girls . \n Finland's health watchdog THL has indicated that more teens are taking up moist tobacco, with 20 percent of boys and six percent of girls in Finland reporting daily use. \n Munter said that in addition to Facebook groups dedicated to selling snus, black market vendors are also active on Instagram and Snapchat. \"Kids get snus from adults. It’s important that we don't raise another generation hooked on nicotine.\""}

Also in New York for meetings this week are four Finnish cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto . \n On Tuesday, Niinistö  spoke about the responsibility of finance ministries  in tackling climate change at the UN Climate Action Summit. \n After fiery remarks by Swedish activist  Greta Thunberg , some 60 world leaders stepped up to the UN podium to deliver their messages and promises for the future of climate action. \n Niinistö's message was that only a \"comprehensive transformation of our societies\" could hope to help the world shift to carbon neutrality. \n Finland aims to be first carbon-negative industrial economy \n \"Halfway measures are not enough. We have to align all our policies with effective climate action,\" Niinistö said. \n At the centre of his speech were the so-called Helsinki Principles, a set of guidelines for concrete action forming the backbone of an international coalition, co-chaired by Finland and Chile, which Niinistö said already has 40 members worldwide. \n \"Climate action requires all the tools controlled by finance ministries. Taxation and budgeting, public investment and procurement – when these instruments work in our favour, a carbon-neutral world is possible.\" \n The president finished his speech with a pledge that Finland would commit completely to its target of becoming the first carbon-negative industrial economy in history. \n \"The bar has been set very high. We want to lead by example. For that, setting targets is not sufficient. Achieving them is what matters,\" said Niinistö. \n Meanwhile in Helsinki on Tuesday, EU agriculture ministers discussed the role of soil carbon sequestration in slowing climate change.

{"text": "The National Coalition was the only political party in favour of expanding a tunnel below Helsinki's city centre to ease traffic congestion when councillors met to discuss the issue on Wednesday. \n The Helsinki city council decided that it would not support plans to  build an underground tunnel that would run seven kilometers  from Helsinki's Sörnäinen district to the West Harbour. \n The Social Democrats, with 12 seats on the 85-member council, tipped the balance in favour of the nays. \n The SDP said the 1.4-billion-euro price tag was too expensive and that resources should instead be directed towards making Helsinki more walkable and improving public transit. \n “Developing public transport means improving access and lowering fares,” SDP councilor  Eveliina Heinäluoma  said. \n The Greens and Left Alliance have also said they reject the building of the tunnel. \n Proponents for the tunnel project have argued that it would offer an underground route for harbour traffic.

{"text": "Finland's papers continue coverage of a  fatal attack  that took place Tuesday in the central city of Kuopio, in which one woman was killed and nine others injured by a  man carrying a sabre-like weapon . The assailant was also injured when he was detained by police. \n Kuopio paper Savon Sanomat  reports  that the attack was the first time in Finnish history that rescue services were alerted to respond to a \"mass shooting\", as emergency services only adopted the new response category this year. Police were alerted at 12:29, and by 12:37 they had apprehended the suspect. \n The nation's most widely-read daily Helsingin Sanomat reports  more details on the suspected attacker : 25-year-old  Joel Otto Aukusti Marin  moved to Kuopio from the municipality of Siilinjärvi in 2015 and studied in the same medical sciences vocational school programme with the deceased woman. The paper spoke with his student flat neighbours, who described him as quiet and introverted. One noted that police discovery of Molotov cocktails in the suspect's room could be linked to two local cases of arson in the area, as two nearby homes were burned to the ground recently. \n HS also reports on  comments from the Interior Minister   Maria Ohisalo,  who said the violent episode was \"very rare in Finland, one of the world's safest societies\". Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the minister said she could not discuss the details of the attack. \n \"But I can take a position on what we politicians can do. There's been a lot of talk about increasing the number of police, and we made a decision on this in the budget. We also want to invest more resources in preventive work,\" she said. \n Six unanswered questions \n The tabloid Iltalehti outlines  six unanswered questions  surrounding the incident. What was the attacker's motive, it asks. A National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) detective tells IL that social and mental problems are typically behind these kinds of incidents, but says he cannot comment on this case specifically. \n IL then asks about the relationship between the attacker and the deceased woman, also noting that most of the people wounded in the attack were female. It is still not certain whether the victims were targeted specifically or if they were randomly chosen. The NBI says the incident is being investigated as a murder case, but the suggestion that it was a premeditated attack is supported by the discovery of petrol bombs in the suspect's flat. \n It is also still unclear whether the suspect was carrying a gun and whether he used it. At one point, the police said the assailant was carrying a firearm but did not use it, but no mention was made of the firearm in the Tuesday press conference. The police said things would be made clear in the criminal investigation. \n IL wonders whether any substance abuse was associated with the attack, and if the assailant planned a murder-suicide attack but was foiled when he was seriously wounded by the police. The tabloid says this would explain the unused gun that police had reported earlier. \n Niinistö meets with Trump  \n In other news, the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat  informs  readers that Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  will be meeting with US President  Donald Trump  on Wednesday in Washington. The leaders are to hold a press conference that will be streamed beginning just before 9pm Finnish time on  Yle Areena . \n Niinistö's visit includes a working lunch with Trump that will include agenda items such as US-Finnish relations, European and Arctic security, and commercial and technological cooperation. \n Editors of Savon Sanomat  suspect  that the Ukraine scandal may be drawn into the meeting in some way, but doubt that the issue will overshadow the proceedings. It quotes the Finnish President,  speaking from the UN Climate Meeting  last week: \n \"I'm not frightened of anything. It is up to the US reporters.

{"text": "Threats to schools \n In the wake of the  Kuopio tragedy , Helsingin Sanomat  takes a look at threats to schools , which occur more often than you might think in Finland. \n In the years 2007-2009, 77 people were referred to psychiatric care after threatening violence at a school. In 2010 that number dropped to just nine, although HS does not give more recent numbers. \n The typical threat comes from a young man, often with a mental health issue, according to HS. Around 40 percent of those who receive psychiatric care after making a threat had experienced bullying in school, and a third had been customers of child protection services. \n There are common threads among those who have actually perpetrated attacks. They include an interest in firearms, mental health issues, a long history of bullying in school and difficulty in resolving conflicts. \n However  Henri Rikander , a safety and security consultant interviewed by HS, says that it’s impossible to build a profile of possible attackers. \n Those planning attacks, however, may give warning signs in the lead-up. Rikander cites research suggesting that in 90 percent of cases researched in the US, an adult was concerned about the attacker’s behaviour in the lead-up to the attack. \n Posti departure ramifications \n The news on Wednesday that Posti CEO  Heikki Malinen  would  resign from his post  would have received considerably more attention had it occurred at a different time. \n As it was, the sword attack in Kuopio and Niinistö’s visit to Washington overshadowed Malinen’s departure, but business daily Kauppalehti does devote  some space  to it on Thursday. \n Malinen departed after controversies over his  generous compensation package  combined with a plan to  slash pay for workers in sorting officers , which were slammed by unions and politicians, and also in the media. \n KL is concerned that Malinen’s treatment in the media and by politicians might deter other qualified individuals from applying to lead state-owned firms. \n Editor  Arno Ahosniemi  says in a comment piece that this is already happening, as head hunters are finding it tough to persuade candidates to take on state-owned firms. \n Ahosniemi links Malinen’s fate to previous instances of political pressure on the leadership of state-owned firms, suggesting that this political impulse to act is reducing the likelihood of good candidates taking on big jobs--and damaging the interests of taxpayers."}

A lawmaker from the northwest municipality where the proceedings are being held, Tynkkynen is suspected of agitation against an ethnic group in a 2016 Facebook post on Islam and terrorism. \n Representing himself in the proceedings, Tynkkynen denied having committed a crime and said that the trial was politically-motivated. \n The prosecutor in the case maintained that Tynkkynen must have known that his Facebook update was racist in nature and constituted defamatory hate speech generally directed at Muslims. The prosecution called for the court to impose a 60-day fine for the offence. \n The  unofficial English translation  of Finland's Criminal Code in this area makes it illegal for a person to \"make available to the public or otherwise spread among the public or keep available for the public information, an expression of opinion or another message where a certain group is threatened, defamed or insulted on the basis of its race, skin colour, birth status, national or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation or disability or a comparable basis.\" \n Possibility of third trial looms \n In his response to the district court, Tynkkynen compared the case to previous trials of two other prominent members of the nationalist Finns Party, MP  Teuvo Hakkarainen  and current chair  Jussi Halla-aho . Both men were convicted on charges of ethnic agitation,  Hakkarainen  in 2017 and  Halla-aho  in 2012. \n Some thirty or so people turned out to follow Tykkynen’s trial in Oulu, including some of his supporters and members of the media, prompting officials to move the proceedings to a larger space. \n Tynkkynen was  already convicted  once in court in 2017 for Facebook comments he posted in 2016. At the time he was found guilty of ethnic agitation and the separate crime of breaching the sanctity of religion. \n A third case is also pending, concerning Facebook posts Tynkkynen wrote in 2017, which have also placed him under suspicion of inciting ethnic agitation. Oulu police have referred that case to the district prosecutor for consideration of charges."}
{"text": "One third of municipal decision-makers and almost half of MPs or their aides have been the target of hate speech due to their work, according to the findings of a new collaborative survey from Open Knowledge Finland, the University of Jyväskylä and Punos Research. \n Two thirds of the lawmakers responding to the poll said they believe that public discourse has triggered more hate speech in recent years. \n “Hate speech can often be prompted by impulsive actions, but it can also be used deliberately to exert political pressure. In these cases, the aim is to silence a certain individual or political view,” says Open University Finland researcher  Aleksi Knuutila . \n Respondents to the survey who had been the target of hate speech said it affected their work significantly. Half of municipal decision-makers said it had reduced their trust in people they did not know, and 42 percent said they were less willing to participate in public debates. Many said that had left or had considered dropping out of politics because of the feedback. \n The first of its kind, the study entitled \"Ruled by hate: Hate speech aiming to influence decision-making in society\" explored the extent and nature of hate speech and its impact on decision-making. It made use of 14 thematic interviews, interactions on Twitter, and more than 1,300 questionnaires that were returned from the Finnish Parliament. \n For purposes of the study, hate speech was defined as \"degrading, threatening or stigmatising expressions that relate to the personal characteristics of the subject or are motivated by intolerance\". \n 200 accounts responsible for half of hostile Twitter messages \n Many politicians who participated in the study said they felt that their involvement in a particular political party was the reason for the hate speech. The aim of hate speech was not just to influence the party’s decisions, but also to persecute decision-makers for being a member of the certain party, the report on the survey concluded. \n The study identified 200 Twitter accounts that were responsible for about half of the hostile Twitter messages sent to lawmakers in Finland. About 75 percent of the offensive tweets came from people who are against migration. \n The report also linked decision-makers' social media activity with the amount of hostile feedback they received. As a rule, MPs who tweeted more than 500 times during the research period were exposed to significant hate speech. In Finland, party leaders do not tend to be as active on Twitter, but during the 2019 parliamentary elections, each of the chairs received hate speech communications, with the exception of the Blue Reform party's  Sampo Terho  and the Swedish People's Party's  Anna-Maja Henriksson . \n \"Men with immigrant backgrounds, like the Social Democratic Party (SDP)'s  Abdirahim Hussein , the Greens'  Ozan Yanar , SDP's  Hussein al-Taee , and the Left Alliance's  Suldaan Said Ahmed  sent far fewer tweets, but nevertheless encountered a lot of harassment,\" the report reads, adding that the results show that candidates with immigrant backgrounds are easily targeted. \n The survey suggests that the threat of hate speech alone impacts political participation. Even decision-makers who reported no hate speech say that the threat of it has reduced their willingness to participate in public discussions. \n Inadequate measures to address problem \n The survey and the interviews both found that lawmakers consider current measures against hate speech in Finland to be inadequate. Election candidates and members of municipal councils say they are often left without support in the face of such harassment. \n The researchers behind the report propose other measures to clamp down on the problem, beyond legal actions. They make a case for stronger value leadership, whereby decision-makers would condemn hate speech more harshly. They also advise that Finland define the limits for acceptable speech in political activities, and encourage more responsible social media platform monitoring. \n The survey was carried out as part of the implementation of the Government’s plan for the analysis, assessment and research activities in 2018."}

They detailed spending increases and other adjustments included in their budget framework plan agreed in late summer. \n The cabinet sailed through the vote by a margin of 97-75 in the 200-seat legislature. \n Technical glitch leads to rare procedure \n The results of the vote were delayed due to problems with parliamentary voting devices. \n Deputy Speaker of Parliament  Juho Eerola  of the opposition Finns Party, who chaired the plenary session, first delayed the vote by five minutes to look into the technical issue. \n As that did not suffice, it was decided to carry out the vote by casting old-fashioned paper ballots.

Rinne and Löfven also talked about sustainable growth, Baltic Sea protection and Arctic issues. \n After their bilateral talks, the two took part in a panel on the future of the Nordic welfare society as part of the SDP's weekend Future Forum seminar in Helsinki, hosted by party secretary  Antton Rönnholm . \n The two discussed efforts to slow climate change, expressing concern over climate change deniers and those attacking young activists such as Sweden's  Greta Thunberg . \n At a joint press conference, they concentrated on EU affairs. Löfven voiced support for a proposal championed by Rinne whereby granting of EU subsidies to member states would be linked to adherence to the rule of law. \n Along with the climate, it has emerged as a main theme of the first half of Finland's six-month EU presidency term, which ends in December. \n Löfven, 62, became the leader of Sweden's SDP in 2012 and has been PM since 2014. Rinne, 56, took the reins of the Finnish SDP in 2014, becoming premier in June this year. \n Johnson agrees to Brexit proposal schedule \n Regarding Brexit, Rinne said that he and Löfven had both planned to speak with British Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  on Friday but that the calls had been cancelled. \n Rinne's office issued a statement early Saturday evening saying that he had spoken with Johnson about his latest Brexit proposal, which was rejected by many EU leaders last week. \n \"I told him that the proposed solutions would not ensure adherence to the Good Friday agreement nor the EU's integrity and functioning of its internal markets,\" Rinne said in the statement. \n \"I told Johnson that it is important to find a solution within a week so that the matter can be properly considered at the October European Council. Johnson said that he agreed on this timetable,\" he went on to say."}
{"text": "Finland's Parliament began debate on Tuesday over the first  state budget proposal  put together by the left-leaning government of Prime Minister  Antti Rinne . Budget discussions will continue throughout the week, and after this, the draft budget will head to various parliamentary committees for further assessment. \n The current government budget proposal would increase the state budget to 57.6 billion euros next year, or 2.1 billion euros more than this year's budget total. Most of the increase is due to implementation of the four-year Government Programme, the cabinet's policy agenda for the next four years. \n The draft of the budget being considered on the parliamentary floor is two billion euros in the red, which means that the national debt would rise to 109 billion euros next year. \n Ministry: Poor economic growth won't help unemployment \n Finland's Ministry of Finance predicts that  economic growth will slow down  next year by one percentage point to just one percent growth in the coming years. This slow economic growth will not help the job market, the ministry reasons, as it forecasts a peak employment rate of only 73 percent by the year 2023. \n Rinne's government has justified its added state budget expenditures and reforms as necessary to push Finland's employment rate to 75 percent by 2023. One of the main goals of the government is to create jobs for 60,000 people, together with Finland's leading labour market organizations. \n Vote of confidence is taste of things to come \n A hint of what kind of parliamentary floor debate will be in store came already last week, when the centre-right National Coalition Party (NCP) called for a  confidence vote  in the government over spending. Critics in the party have  criticized  the Rinne government for raising taxes and increasing state expenditures with no guarantee of added revenue. The interpellation fell by a vote of 97-75 on Friday. \n NCP chair  Petteri Orpo  warned in August that Rinne government's economic policies will bankrupt Finland, but he later softened his tone and said that Finland was \"on the road to repeating what happened in Greece\". \n The NCP has pushed Rinne's coalition to prove that they have concrete employment-boosting measures in place to reach their 75 percent employment target. They say that from where they sit, it looks as though their plans will weaken the job market instead of improve it. \n Jussi Halla-aho , chair of the nationalist Finns Party, Finland's largest opposition political party, has said that he feels the government's employment calculations are irresponsible in light of the weakening global economy. \n Finns Party politicians have also opposed increases to development cooperation funding and fuel taxes. \n First review in August 2020 \n Finance minister  Mika Lintilä  will present the government's revenue and expenditure proposals to the Finnish Parliament this week. \n In discussion surrounding last week's confidence vote, Lintilä stressed that the government was committed to achieving its 75 percent employment goal and balancing public finances by the year 2023, providing economic growth remains normal. \n Finland's government has calculated that in order to reach its 75 percent target, it will have to create 60,000 new jobs by 2023. It says it will do its first review of the situation in August 2020, when the methods it will use to create 30,000 jobs should be known. \n Prime Minister Rinne has made several references to an entry in the  Government Programme  that says the government will pursue a counter-cyclical or stimulus-based economic policy if the global economy, eurozone economy, or the domestic economy were to fall into a severe economic downturn. \n NCP chair Orpo says that the government is in his view wasting stimulus money next year, as the economy is forecast to continue feeble growth."}
{"text": "An Oulu court has slapped Finns Party lawmaker  Sebastian Tynkkynen  with a 50-day fine after convicting him  on charges of ethnic agitation . The total fine amounts to slightly more than 4,000 euros. \n The conviction came over texts and images Tynkkynen posted on Facebook back in 2016. According to the court, Tynkkynen’s writings about Islamic groups were premeditated, racist in nature and constituted defamatory hate speech that targetted Muslims and were likely to provoke contempt and even hatred based on intolerance of Islamic groups. \n The court ruled that Tynkkynen must have understood that there was a clear connection between the images and texts he posted and that his audience would have understood him to mean that all Muslims are terrorists. The prosecutor originally called for the court to impose a 60-day fine on the defendant. \n Second conviction for same offence \n Tynkkynen indicated on Thursday that he intends to appeal the verdict and sentence, arguing that his Facebook posts are not a punishable offence. \n \"An update that defends the security of Europeans and Finns should not result in a 4,000-euro fine,\" he declared. \n The court also ordered the Oulu lawmaker to remove the posts from Facebook and Instagram. \n Thursday’s conviction is not the Finns Party MP’s first. He was also convicted of ethnic agitation and breach of religious peace in 2017 and sentenced to pay a 50-day fine at the time. \n He is also suspected of another instance of ethnic agitation in another Facebook post in 2017. Oulu police have investigated this case and referred it to local prosecutors for consideration of charges. A decision has not yet been made on the matter. \n Finns Party chair: No sanctions from party \n Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  said he does not believe that Tynkkynen will face any consequences as a result of his second conviction. \n \"Of course this is something one dare not say or you might end up in court: it’s not terribly controversial to say that Islamic terrorism is linked to the worship of Allah and it is my understanding that that is the reason for Tynkkynen’s verdict,\" Halla-aho commented. \n The Finns Party chair questioned the conviction and pondered whether or not legislation regarding ethnic agitation was up to date. He called for clarification of that part of the statute and for improvements to its legal certainty. \n \"The agitation clause seems to be becoming a kind of perpetual motion machine, or a charge-and-convict dispenser that is targetting Finns Party politicians,\" he remarked. \n \"To my understanding, Tynkkynen said that Islamic terrorists are linked to the worship of Allah. The judicial system has now apparently declared that it is illegal to say this. This almost absurd interpretation of the law undermines the credibility of the prosecution service and the judiciary,\" the party leader said. \n Finns Party parliamentary group chair  Ville Tavio  noted that the sentence is not yet enforceable, as an appeal may be pending. As a result the parliamentary group will not take any action regarding the case. \n Police are currently investigating suspected ethnic agitation offences involving three other Members of Parliament. They are ex-Christian Democratic Party chair  Päivi Räsänen ,  Hussein al-Taee  of the Social Democrats and  Juha Mäenpää  of the Finns Party."}
{"text": "Turkey’s military campaign in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria will complicate relations in the Middle East and force people to flee their homes, according to Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö . It will also place the Nato military alliance in an awkward position, Niinistö said in an Yle interview on Thursday. \n On Wednesday evening the Finnish government called on Turkey to end its bombardment of northern Syria and said that it does not condone Ankara’s actions. \n \"It must of course be condemned, Finland has said so. Last night the EU also found consensus on it,\" Niinistö pointed out. \n Turkey aims to create a so-called security zone in Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria and intends to use it to accommodate people who are fleeing violence in Syria. Niinistö described the plan as a mass displacement. \n \"Turkey, which in itself has borne responsibility for three million refugees, would now like to push them into this so-called safe zone that apparently it must first annex from the Kurds. At the same time the Kurdish population will have to flee the area,\" Niinistö observed. \n The president speculated that some people will suffer in the Turkish attack, while others will benefit. However he noted that the Kurdish people under attack will always suffer. \n \"Perhaps Syria, Iran and even Russia too stand to benefit,\" he conjectured. \n People on the move \n The Kurdish population has begun to move to escape the air raids and artillery fires and have been heading to southernmost Kurdish areas. Niinistö pointed out that whenever people start moving, they will head somewhere. \n The target of the Turkish military campaign also includes areas close to the al-Hol refugee camp, where former Isis fighters are being held. It has been estimated that the Kurdish authorities do not have enough resources to guard the camp while fighting against Turkey. According to information obtained by Yle, EU foreign ministers will discuss Syria and the al-Hol situation on Monday. \n Niinistö said that he considers Turkey’s actions in Syria as descriptive example of a geopolitical puzzle. For example EU countries have used Turkey as a buffer state to take care of millions of refugees in exchange for money, he noted. \n \"There are competing interests. You suddenly notice that your worst enemy may have something on which you are yourself dependent. And conversely, your best friend may be someone one who’s not all that pleasant. This is unfortunate but this is the geopolitical puzzle,\" he commented. \n No advance warning of US pullout \n Niinistö said that Turkey’s campaign in Syria did not come as a surprise. He noted that Ankara had long planned a safety zone and had previously conducted raids and bigger operations in Syria. At the same time, the United States and President  Donald Trump  in particular has long wanted to disengage from Syria. Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from the region offered Turkey an opportunity to act, he said. \n Niinistö said that Trump did not indicate that he planned to withdraw from Syria when the pair met in Washington last week. \n He said that he noted that a few days ago Trump announced that the US would only be involved in conflicts that advanced American interests. \n \"I think quite many [people] are wondering about the scope of this announcement. We all know that he has been quite reticent about the role of world police and that has also prompted criticism in EU. The US may now be missed in that role.\" \n The president said that Europe must now think about the changing role of the US, noting that Nato is also in an odd position. Turkey is a Nato member, as is the US. According to Niinistö, the current situation means that two Nato member states are \"quite involved\" in Syria. Nato has not condemned Turkey’s actions, but some of the EU states that have denounced them are Nato members. \n Niinistö said he doesn’t believe that Turkey’s attacks in Syria will ease the situation. \n \"How could there be balance when bombs are flying? This will definitely complicate the situation further,\" he concluded."}

{"text": "The Oulu-based  Kaleva reports  an interview with Finland's foreign minister,  Pekka Haavisto , on the situation at the Turkish-Syrian border in which he said that the EU is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation, the increased number of refugees and growing problems for civilians in northern and north-eastern Syria. \n According to Haavisto, international organizations were prepared to deal with 100,000 internal refugees, but fresh reports from the region have changed the picture. These organizations now believe there will be up to 400,000 people fleeing the fighting. \n \"A humanitarian crisis is at hand,\" Foreign Minister Haavisto said in a phone interview with the Finnish News Agency STT. \n Turkey has partnered with the EU to stem the flow of refugees into Europe, receiving economic aid for the some 4 million displaced persons in the country, 3.6 million of which are from Syria. \n According to the Haavisto, these refugees are focused on returning to their homes, not to Europe or the border zone Turkey is trying to establish. \n \"If someone wants to turn them towards Europe, they will have to do a lot of work to do so. These people didn't leave for Europe before, but have been waiting to be able to go back home,\" stated Foreign Minister Haavisto. \n No to refugee adoption \n Finland's largest circulation daily, Helsingin Sanomat, carries  a front-page feature  about the continuing, but so far unsuccessful efforts of a Finnish couple to legally adopt an adult asylum seeker. \n Erja and Timo Noroviita , a retired couple in the southern coastal city of Loviisa volunteered at a local refugee reception centre near their home, working with asylum seekers who came to Finland in 2015. \n It was there they met  Zirak Bayati , an Iraqi asylum seeker, now 33 years of age, took him under their wing and brought him into their family and thought of him as a son. \n In time, the Noroviitas decided they wanted to legally adopt Zirak. The adoption application was rejected. \n There were two main factors working against the plan. Zirak Bayati is an adult. His application for asylum has been rejected, although the decision is being appealed. \n In rejecting the adoption application, the court said that Bayati is too old for adoption and that his ties with the Noroviita family were not established during childhood. \n The adoption of an adult in Finland is possible only under exceptional circumstances and even then applicable in cases of the children of blended families or foster children who for some reason could not be adopted as minors. \n No separate statistics are kept on the adoption of asylum seekers, but the Finnish Immigration Service told Helsingin Sanomat that it was unable to say if there has been even a single adoption of anyone undergoing processing for possible asylum. \n Zirak Bayati is now in the situation that he has not been granted asylum, but be cannot be deported because Iraq refuses to accept forced repatriations. \n The  number of paperless individuals  has risen in recent years. According to some estimates, there are several thousand in the country, most of them young Iraqis. \n \"In practice, Finland has made thousands of people paperless migrants,\" Erja Noroviita said to the paper. \"Instead, there could be another alternative.\" \n The Noroviitas have appealed the decision against Zirak Bayati's adoption. A second rejection is so likely that their own lawyers declined to take the case. \n President in Africa, on to Japan \n The tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  is among the papers with an item on President  Sauli Niinistö 's first visit to an African nation, starting on Tuesday. \n President Niinistö is on an official visit to Ethiopia on Tuesday and Wednesday. \n During his stay, he is scheduled to meet with leaders there including his Ethiopian counterpart Sahle-Work Zewde, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the recipient of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. \n Niinistö will speak at a conference on climate change and be one of the keynote speakers at an event focused on women's economic empowerment. \n Turun Sanomat  reports that President Niinistö and his spouse Jenni Haukio are scheduled to travel to Japan on the 21st of this month to attend the coronation of Emperor Naruhito. \n Those bleeping potholes \n A road sign in the rural reaches of the town of Kangasala, just east of Tampere, has locals chuckling and the authorities fuming,  according to the daily Aamulehti . \n Drivers in the area recently noticed a road sign warning of potholes with an addition explanatory sign attached, in official-looking colours and font, reading \"Koko perkeleen tie\" - roughly translated, \"The whole damn road\". \n The paper sent out reporter to check on the sign who confirmed its accuracy. \n Aamulehti says its investigation has been unable to determine if the extra note has been posted by the City of Kangasala, the local Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency, the road maintenance board, or a disgruntled local. \n One thing, it says is for sure though - the strong language has enhanced the effectiveness of the warning. \n Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment intends to remove the extra information from the sign and is considering filing a criminal complaint."}

{"text": "Finland's government is committed to increasing the guarantee fees paid by mining companies to offset the environmental damages mine operations may cause, according to Minister of Economic Affairs  Katri Kulmuni . \n Increasing the payments is part of Mining Act reforms, which Parliament means to take up over the next year. \n A citizens' initiative  calling for the fee hike was discussed in a preliminary debate on the proposed reforms on Wednesday. \n \"The shared concerns about mining company guarantees have been recognised by the citizens and the government alike, and they will be addressed,\" Kulmuni said. \n The deposit sums are intended to mitigate potential environmental damage and to cover the eventual cost of shuttering a mining operation. For instance, the Hitura nickel mine in Northern Ostrobothnia went bankrupt and cost taxpayers more than 16 million euros. \n A June report by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development was the first to demonstrate the need for mining guarantee fee increases. In many cases the old deposit sum only covered minimal procedures such as fencing off a closed mining site. \n \"That report has a very high standing among environmental and business groups alike. I don't think anyone would oppose this move,\" Kulmuni said. \n Tax to boost regions \n Kulmuni also said she hopes lawmakers will consider a new  mining tax . Politicians are on board with the plan, as seen in an Yle poll from early 2019 where every respondent from the government parties backed the tax or at least looking into the possibility of one. \n A mining tax could be collected from a company's turnover or the value of unearthed minerals. \n Government intends to reaffirm the position of municipalities and land owners in mining-related issues. Kulmuni said that tax euros should be funneled to mining regions, not to the government. \n \"It would be important in terms of social acceptability that the taxman directs those sums to the region where the mining occurs. The municipality rakes in the benefits, but is also responsible for keeping the environment clean.\""}

Antti Kurvinen, who chairs the Centre's parliamentary group, said the menu adjustment was part of a 'culture war', and questioned students' automatic enrolment in the student union that owns Unicafe. \n Iltalehti, meanwhile,  looks  outside the metropolitan centre of climate-conscious youth to ask if other student restaurants are going to follow suit. \n Perhaps not surprisingly they mostly answered that no, they did not want to immediately make a menu change they could expect to be criticised by some of the country's most senior politicians. \n Even so, in Jyväskylä and Oulu they said the proportion of vegetarian meals they sell is rising and they try to source their ingredients responsibly. \n Haavisto in the lead \n Alma Media outlets all carry  a poll  on the 2024 (!) presidential election.

Appearing in an Yle Ykkösaamu interview on Saturday, Andersson said that 29 million euros in additional funding will be devoted to increasing counselling resources in Finnish schools during the current government term. \n \"Bullying at school leaves life-long scars and life-long trauma. It should be treated as a violent act, as it is often a matter of both mental and physical violence,\" she said. \n The 29-million-euro sum will be used to improve the availability of psychologists and counsellors in both primary and secondary schools. Andersson says her ministry is preparing new pupil-to-professional ratios that will be enforced on a nationwide level to ensure that all schoolchildren will have equal services. \n \"We've set an ambitious goal to raise our education level, so this means we've also got to make sure that all children feel confident about going to school,\" the minister said. \n Too much regional variance \n She said that there is currently too much variation in the availability of professional help at Finland's schools. \n \"One single school counsellor can have between 700 and 2,000 pupils as clients at present, or be responsible for up to 12 different locations,\" Andersson said. \n Andersson said that the education ministry plans to introduce the new ratios in Finland's secondary schools already during this parliamentary term. \n \"It is linked to the government's goal of extending compulsory education. If we enact a major change that aims to make all young people study until the age of 18, then we have to make sure that student support services are improved,\" she said. \n United message required \n Andersson hopes that she can entice all of Finland's parliamentary parties to participate in drawing up a national action plan to combat school bullying. \n \"I'm inviting all of the parliamentary parties to join this work because this is a matter that transcends party lines. We need a united message from the nation's decision-makers that conveys the seriousness of the situation,\" she said. \n During the interview, Andersson also discussed a  pilot project  to assess changes in learning outcomes if early childhood education in Finland was extended from one year to two years, and her initiative to do away with sibling supplements to home care allowances in order to encourage better participation in early childhood education opportunities."}

{"text": "Prime Minister  Antti Rinne’s  sartorial habits, health, policy opinions and backroom manoeuvres are all in the news this week after a new authorised biography was published. \n The book is by journalists  Lauri Nurmi  and  Matti Mörttinen  and covers  Rinne’s journey  to lead the government from childhood to the present day. \n One  story to emerge  is that Rinne is positive about allowing Muslim congregations the same right to tax their members as Finland’s established religious denominations, as they have raised the issue in discussions with him. \n \"It shows that they want to integrate into society by themselves gathering resources to fund their operations,\" said Rinne in the book, adding that such a model could also prevent foreign funding of Islamic communities in Finland. \n Helsingin Sanomat  reports  that the book also notes that while he was recovering from pneumonia and a heart attack earlier this year, Rinne asked an advisor if he might attend election debates in a wheelchair as former US President Woodrow Wilson did. \n \"Antti, you are not Wilson,\" he was told, and given a deadline to recover or the party would need to choose a successor to fight  April’s election . \n That ultimatum gave him additional motivation to recover, according to the book, and he was better in time to fight and  win the election . \n Ilta-Sanomat also has  a story  on his habit of buying his suits from fairly downmarket outlets near his home in the Päijät-Häme region, right up until he was Prime Minister and got marched to a swankier Helsinki outlet to purchase five near-identical blue suits and one black one. \n \"When I have clothes I like, I keep them so long they wear out,\" said Rinne. \n Nokia shares tumble \n It was a  bad day for Nokia on Thursday , as they announced their third quarter results and said that they would not be paying a dividend this - or next - quarter. \n The company’s share price tumbled on the Helsinki stock exchange, and that prompted Taloussanomat to  wonder  how much money individual, well-known shareholders had lost on what the paper termed 'Black Thursday'. \n Nokia is of course a very popular share in Finland that enriched large numbers of people in the 1990s, so the paper’s list of MPs and celebrities is pretty long. \n Some suggest that the price has fallen so it might be time for (other people) to buy the stock, but it remains to be seen if that will happen. \n Business daily Kauppalehti took a  different tack , wondering just how the company could have done so badly. The paper suggests that somebody might be willing to supply 5g networks at any price, undercutting Nokia and Swedish rival Ericsson. \n That only leaves one company in the same market who might be the lower-cost provider: Chinese state-owned Huawei. \n How dull is Helsinki? \n Ilta-Sanomat  picks up a story  from Russian outlet Ria Novosti detailing the results of a poll of Russian tourists. \n The somewhat surprising result? Helsinki is the dullest town in Europe, according to 30 percent of respondents. \n The biggest problems for the Finnish capital were the weather and the lack of sights to see, according to the pollsters. \n In second spot was Bratislava, and the third snoozefest vacation spot was the Czech spa town of Karlovy Vary. \n IS notes that the provocative results did draw a reaction on social media from Saint Petersburg residents, who share a very similar climate at least with Helsinki. \n “It’s not boring, just peaceful,” said one quoted in IS."}
{"text": "A citizens' initiative calling for the decriminalisation of cannabis use is headed to parliament for consideration by MPs. \n The initiative received the required 50,000 signatures on Thursday evening, which means the document can now be handed to Finnish MPs for consideration. \n The initiative calls for the decriminalisation of possession, use and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis. \n Most of the support came in the final days of the initiative, which was started at the beginning of May. At the beginning of October the initiative had less than half of the needed signatures, but support surged over the past week in the run-up to the initiative's deadline, 1 November. \n The main sponsor of the initiative, activist  Janne Karvinen , said he was not surprised about the last-minute boost in support. \n \"People usually leave things to the last minute. We've been promoting this recently and getting our message out on social media. There's certainly more than 50,000 - or even more than 100,000 - people in Finland who support this issue,\" Karvinen told Yle on Wednesday evening as the initiative still only had garnered around 41,000 signatures. \n Karvinen said decriminalising cannabis is warranted because prohibition of the drug hasn't worked. \n \"Primarily, punishing [the use of cannabis] does more harm than good. It promotes social exclusion and [convictions for cannabis possession] can hinder a person's access to jobs or study spots,\" he explained. \n Changing attitudes \n Oulu-based newspaper Kaleva  reported  in July that people convicted of minor drug offences are barred from the ability to study or work across more than 60 sectors. According to the paper, the chief physician of substance abuse centre A-Clinic as well as a research professor from the National Institute for Health and Welfare both suggested that the country should decriminalise drug use. \n Earlier this month Finland’s Supreme Court ruled that motorists will likely  not be charged  for driving under the influence days after using cannabis. \n Karvinen said he thinks it is possible that Finnish Parliament would pass the measures called for in the citizens' initiative. \n \"I believe that MPs do not want to oppose the benefits [decriminalisation] would bring,\" he said, noting that Prime Minister's government programme also mentioned substance abuse policy reforms. \n Several European countries have already decriminalised cannabis use and it is legal in many states in the US. On Thursday, one of the Democratic front-runners in the US Presidential race, Senator Bernie Sanders, unveiled his own plans to legalise cannabis nationwide, calling for an end to the \"destructive war on drugs.\" \n Canada legalised the use, possession and cultivation of cannabis last year \n However a Finnish researcher on drug policy from the University of Lapland, Mika Luoma-aho, said he thinks Finnish lawmakers will reject the initiative. \n \"I don't think Parliament is ready to accept it. But it will force a debate on the issue. I want to hear the discussion that quashes the initiative and then continue the dialogue on that basis,\" Luoma-aho said."}
{"text": "Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  says that the Turkish offensive in northeast Syria has not significantly affected the al-Hol detention camp, where those being held include  Finnish women and their children . They are believed to be family members of so-called Islamic State (Isis) combatants. \n \"Conditions at the camp are stable at the moment. But it cannot be a permanent state of affairs that there are underage children at the camp,\" Haavisto said on the Yle current affairs programme Ykkösaamu on Saturday. \n The foreign minister stressed that Finland and the EU are working on a daily basis to resolve the situation of their citizens at the camp. \n \"We don't have armed force or any other power to get these people out of there. If people come out of there, they must be able to do so safely. There are neighbouring countries that consider at least the adults to be criminals as they have acted within Isis,\" he said. \n Haavisto added that the Kurdish administration in Syria has been informed that the Finnish citizens in the camp have a right to return to their homeland. \n 2024 presidential bid? No comment \n Turning to domestic politics at the end of the interview, Haavisto was asked about the 2024 presidential election. He replied that it was too early to comment on that. \n According to a recent survey published by Alma Media, Haavisto, 61, is so far the overwhelming front-runner to succeed President  Sauli Niinistö , whose second and final term ends on 1 March 2024. \n In the poll, former Greens chair and UN official Haavisto garnered 33 percent support. The second-most popular candidate at this early stage was Centre Party veteran and former European Commissioner  Olli Rehn  with 11 percent support. Rehn, 57, took over as Governor of the Bank of Finland last year. \n In the first and only round of this past spring's presidential election, Haavisto came in a distant second to Niinistö, picking up 12.4 percent compared to 62.7 percent for the incumbent. \n In their previous match-up during the 2012 election, Niinistö defeated Haavisto in the second round by a margin of roughly 63 to 37 percent."}
{"text": "The government's ambitious climate targets can be achieved without negatively impacting people's everyday lives, says Prime Minister  Antti Rinne . \n This is despite the fact that all possible measures must be sought to fend off global warming, he told Yle on Sunday. Rinne did not directly rule out rationing purchases of petrol and diesel, as  proposed by a panel of economic researchers  last week. \n \"Personally, I don't eliminate any alternative before it has been studied and considered whether it would be a good way to move things forward,\" Rinne said during the traditional 'Prime Minister's Interview Hour' programme on Yle's Radio Suomi on Sunday. \n \"Let's make vegetables a bit cheaper\" \n One such measure, he said, could be more \"climate-friendly\" food, as suggested in the government programme adopted in early June. Rinne said that taxes could be lowered on vegetables, but not on meat. \n \"I should have said this directly last spring, but I'm saying it now, in other words let's make vegetables a bit cheaper through taxation and leave meat as it is. That's how we'll guide [consumption],\" Rinne said. \n Rinne's centre-left cabinet, which took office nearly five months ago, has ambitious goals when it comes to countering climate change, but it has been criticised for a lack of concrete means to attain them. \n Carbon-neutral by 2035 \n The PM says that Finland will reach carbon-neutrality by 2035 by cutting emissions from transport and energy production. As he sees it, there is no need to intervene in process industry, or to make major changes in agriculture. \n \"They can be realised through the kind of policy where regular people's day-to-day lives certainly change, but not for the worse,\" Rinne said. \n As decisions are made, corrective decisions can also be made that eliminate social inequalities, he said. \n The premier told reporters that he wants to calm the debate over measures aimed at combating climate change, and that he is confident that the government's goals will be reached. \n \"This discussion is now going a bit overboard here and there, spurring fears and uncertainty among regular citizens that their own lives will now immediately be destroyed by measures against climate change,\" Rinne suggested. \n \"In this debate, I'd warn various actors that we don't need to do the kinds of things that would significantly undermine or worsen regular people's daily lives.\""}
{"text": "Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  went on national broadcaster  Yle's traditional 'Question Time'  programme on Sunday and spoke on a variety of issues; local daily  Turun Sanomat highlighted a few key topics , among which was Rinne's cautious view on the repercussions of the recent death of  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , leader of terrorist group Isis. \n \"The fight against Isis troops is still not over. If these dramatic events are true, the death of the leader effectively raises the risk of retaliatory terrorist strikes,\" TS quoted Rinne as saying. \n US President  Donald Trump  announced on Sunday that American troops cornered al-Baghdadi in Idlib, Syria where the terrorist leader committed suicide by detonating an explosive, also killing three of his children. \n TS wrote that Rinne saw little chance of the European Union reacting quickly to the developments in Syria due to the EU's principle of unanimity. He said that Finland's view has long been that issues of foreign policy should be decided by majority vote in the EU for faster responses to crises. \n Rinne also touched on other phenomena, such as abolishing daylight savings time in Finland in favour of a permanent 'summer time'. The European Parliament  has already approved a bill  that would put an end to moving the hour hands twice a year in all EU states by 2021. EU governments still have to agree on the proposal. \n \"We would have more sunlight in the evenings. The 2021 deadline seems unfeasible,\" said Rinne. \n Off the clock, on the phone \n The  breakneck pace of working life  and the  stress it can bring  are always hot topics, and one reason is that social media and other modes of online communication may blur the distinction between labour and leisure. \n Daily  Helsingin Sanomat runs a piece  reporting that employee organisations and health professionals alike are worried about the effect of workplace group chats on instant messaging platforms such as Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger taking up precious free time. \n Service workers' union Pam  featured an article  in its members' magazine a week ago that urged employees and employers to seek common rules when it comes to allowing their work to follow them home. \n The health risks of after-hours message floods are also of concern to the Union of Health and Social Care Professionals (Tehy). Negotiation manager  Riikka Rapinoja  said in HS the union's stance is clear: work should stay at work, and no one should be expected to constantly follow Whatsapp notifications after they've clocked out. \n \"Employees contract out their working time to their employers, for which they are paid a salary. This is the deal,\" Rapinoja said. \n HS wrote that the pressure to stay in group chats can be high even if it isn't an official responsibility. Psychology professor  Ulla Kinnunen  said she does not endorse strict lines between work and leisure time, as working life expands and changes. \n \"It goes two ways. Employees might be more inclined than before to sort out personal errands while on the job, as well as work after they've gone home, although spillage in this direction is much rarer.\" \n Second Nurmijärvi school burns \n The Southern Finnish municipality of Nurmijärvi was shocked early on Monday morning when a local school caught fire. Most Finnish papers,  including Ilta-Sanomat , carried the story of the blaze that firefighters said would take most of Monday to quell. \n Fire chief  Yrjö Jalava  said the Valkjärvi school building would be completely destroyed. The fire department was able to salvage some personal property before the fire expanded out of control. The school used to teach grades 1—6, IS wrote. \n The fire was the second to shock Nurmijärvi in a short period, after the Lepsämä school burned down on Saturday a week before. Police are investigating the Lepsämä fire as arson, while the cause of the Valkjärvi fire is still unknown."}
{"text": "Knowledge and discussion are the themes for this year’s annual Independence Day Gala, the office of President  Sauli Niinistö  announced on Wednesday. \n \"Finland’s strength has always been the ability to work together, making room for different opinions and using knowledge in diverse ways,\" Niinistö was quoted as saying in a statement. \n The president’s office said that technological development has changed people’s relationship with information, which is now more accessible and the threshold for engaging in debate is lower. On the other hands, the tone of national debate has hardened, the statement noted. \n \"Everyone can help create a considerate discussion culture, promote confidence in scientific knowledge and expertise and, most importantly, respect truth. This builds trust,\" the president added. \n The president’s office has already begun sending out invitations to this year’s formal reception. Niinistö and his wife  Jenni Haukio  have invited a total of 1,700 guests. According to tradition, guests will include war veterans and Finland’s wartime medical volunteers, known as Lottas. \n Last year the theme of the gala was  the environment . The event is broadcast live from the Presidential Palace and is  one of the most-watched television programmes  of the year."}
{"text": "More than 52,000 people have signed a  citizens' initiative calling for an aviation tax , surpassing the 50,000 certified signatures needed to send it to MPs for consideration. \n Any Finnish citizens aged 18 or over can sign or start such an initiative, which lapses if sufficient signatures are not collected within six months. \n The flight tax initiative was launched on 2 May, so would have lapsed on Saturday. As of early October, the initiative had only collected around 7,000 names. By Wednesday, that was up to 25,000. As Thursday began, that had risen to just over 33,000. In its final spurt on Thursday, it gathered more than 17,000 signatories to break the 50,000 barrier around 11pm. Signatures can be collected either in paper form or via a secured online system. \n Revenues would be earmarked for environment \n According to the initiative, an eco-tax or fee would be tacked on to all flight tickets. The revenues \"should be earmarked so as to most effectively guide environmental policy\" toward cutting emissions. As virtually all other forms of transport are now taxed, proponents argue that this amounts to a tax break or indirect subsidy for airlines. \n The initiative calls for the fee to variable and based on \"the climate impact of various types of flights\". It does not propose any specific tax rate but points out that the flight fee in neighbouring Sweden ranges between six and 40 euros per passenger. \n Sweden adopted an aviation tax last year, which was followed by a decline in flight passengers and rapid growth in train ridership. \n Austria, Britain, France, Germany and Norway also levy some form of aviation tax. Supporters hope that the growing number of national fees will lead to an EU-wide scheme. If no EU deal is found, the Netherlands plans to introduce a 7.50 euro ticket tax for departing passengers from 2021. \n Support among government parties \n Last December, the Finnish News Agency STT surveyed views on an eco-tax among the main parties in the Finnish Parliament. \n The strongest support was among MPs from the Left Alliance and the Greens, which both joined the new government in June. Taking the dimmest view were those from the opposition Finns Party and the Centre, which carried over from the past government into the current one. At the time, Centre MPs called for an international rather than national agreement. \n An Yle survey of European Parliament candidates last spring showed similar results, with the Greens and Left most supportive and the Finns Party the least enthusiastic."}
{"text": "Finnish President  Sauli Niinistö  wants to shorten the length of the presidential term of office in Finland, reports the regional newspaper Savon Sanomat. \n Niinistö said in an interview with the paper that the term should be shortened, as the current six-year term is exceptionally long. \n Finnish law currently limits a president's total time in office to two terms, or 12 years in total. \n The president says that a four or five-year term would be a better model, with three four-years terms possible if the current 12-year limit continues, or two five-year terms if the limit would be reduced to 10 years total. \n He said the problem is not that the government changes every four years in the middle of the presidential term, as Niinistö said that the longer presidential term also brings continuity, but rather the sticking point is the nature of the work, as it is very demanding and requires a high level of commitment. \n \"In opposition to general opinion, it is very time intensive job,\" Niinistö said."}
{"text": "The administration led by former union boss  Antti Rinne  has completed 150-odd days in government and has had little time to begin making good on the pledges in  its government programme . \n Rinne leads a disparate coalition spanning the political spectrum, and some tensions have been on show in recent weeks. Is it possible to balance the Centre Party’s rural base with the Greens’ urban, environmentalist focus? Can the Left Alliance and the economically liberal Swedish People’s Party agree on economic policy? \n The setup is certainly different to the unified approach of the Sipilä government, and that shows in some of the compromises made in Rinne’s first months in office, even as the governing parties promise big moves on several fronts. \n Voters may still be waiting to see how the new administration fulfills those promises given that it’s still early days, says Yle political journalist  Helmiina Suhonen . At the same time, she says that the Rinne government’s climate actions don’t match the lofty goal of carbon neutrality by 2035. \n \"Even in 150 days there should be more to give than assurances of making a roadmap for your goals. People may not be pleased because the goals are so grandiose,\" Suhonen says. \n Easing work-based immigration \n The government has also pledged to raise the employment rate to 75 percent by 2023, but analysts are sceptical about whether that can be achieved without more significant policy initiatives. \n \"What we see so far is really not in line with the target of creating 60,000 jobs, that’s hard for regular citizens to believe,\" she added. \n The government has been under pressure to address lengthy waits in visa processing for highly-skilled foreign workers. \n In response the government has pledged to transfer the administration of work-based immigration to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, splitting it off from the Finnish Immigration Service and thereby potentially speeding up approvals. \n According to Suhonen, this is an area that could provide the administration with \"an easy win\". \n \"It is one of the easiest things to do at this point and it is something concrete they can attempt. Other things like attracting people to come to Finland are more complex and involve many different players,\" she adds. \n Good reviews on govt cooperation \n Even so, the list of reforms Rinne administration intends to undertake in this area  is long and ambitious . \n Suhonen says the government may be hampered by the fact that the five-party coalition does not always appear to be on the same page on some issues. The Greens and the Centre Party are especially antagonistic, having clashed over environmental issues  as well as internal security.  \n In spite of their differences, Suhonen says the cooperation has gone \"surprisingly well\" and she notes that there may be no other option than for them to \"just get along\". \n \"Smaller parties like the Greens or Left Alliance have no other choice if they want to be in government. The Centre may have some options, though,\" she continues. \n Rinne not afraid of conflict \n Prime Minister Antti Rinne took over the reins of government on the cusp of Finland’s presidency of the Council of the European Union. Suhonen offers a mixed review of his tenure since then, noting that Rinne has shown himself to be adept at managing conflict within a group, she adds. \n \"He is used to it and he’s not afraid of conflict. He is using this \"iltakoulu\" approach, something that [ Juha ]  Sipilä  didn’t really do during his term,” she says, referring to the tradition of informal after-hours discussion groups advocated by President  Sauli Niinistö  in 2011 that dates back to the 1930s. \n Otherwise, Suhonen identifies a tendency to mixed messaging as one of Rinne’s weaknesses. \n \"He has lots of ideas and may not always share them with his teammates. It is not always clear what the message is and that may be a handicap.\" \n This week  the All Points North podcast  reviews the government's first 150-odd days in office.

The Green Party is in third spot, making it the most popular government party in this poll. \n The Finns Party’s new support appears to be coming from SDP voters, according to pollsters Taloustutkimus. \n The party has clear policy differences on climate change, opposing new taxes on fuels and loudly supporting the right of Finns to eat meat in the face of efforts to reduce agricultural impact on the climate. \n Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  also frequently talks about immigration and migrants. This week he sparked a social media storm by taking on an SDP councillor and taxi driver of Somali origin who claimed to have refused a fare when his passenger racially abused him. \n Halla-aho suggested the councillor,  Abdirahim 'Husu' Hussein , had broken traffic laws by stopping on the highway. \n Taloustutkimus interviewed 3,414 people between 2 October and 5 November, and 2,397 people gave their party allegiance.

The initiative calls for decriminalisation of possession, use and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis. \n Pekonen, however, added that her views are not the Left Alliance’s official position on the citizens' initiative. \n \"This is my personal view on the matter.\" \n Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo  also said she was in favour of the citizens' initiative in a Facebook post last week. \n According to daily Helsingin Sanomat, Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  stated in Parliament on Thursday that the government was \"not moving ahead\" in eliminating punishments for cannabis use. \n Police oppose decriminalisation \n National Police Commissioner  Seppo Kolehmainen , meanwhile, takes a stricter line on cannabis. He said drug use should not be decriminalised in an MTV News interview last week. \n \"Police see death, violence, abuse, prostitution, family suffering and crime in general in the world of drugs. It is terribly difficult to accept any form of legalisation of drugs,” Kolehmainen said in the television interview. \n Minister of Justice  Anna-Maja Henriksson  also  had a dim view of the citizens' initiative.  “I do not believe that it is most important to decriminalise the use of cannabis, but rather to [seek] a more effective substance abuse policy,\" Henriksson told Yle recently."}
{"text": "Jussi Halla-aho , chair of the nationalist Finns Party, led by a clear margin when Finns were asked which party leader has been most successful in their post. Nearly a quarter of respondents chose Halla-aho when presented with a list of party chairs. \n Only Left Alliance chair  Li Andersson  came anywhere near, selected by 16 percent of respondents. The leaders of the other half-dozen parties in Parliament all scored below 10 percent support. \n Last month, Jyväskylä-based pollster Tietoykkönen queried more than 1,000 people for the Uutissuomalainen newspaper group, which published the findings on Saturday. \n Nearly one third of respondents were unable to pick an effective party leader when offered a list of the chairs of all parties and groups in the legislature. \n Support for Halla-aho, Andersson up since spring \n Since a similar poll was carried out in April, Halla-aho's support rose by 10 percentage points, from 14 to 24 percent. \n Halla-aho, 48, has led the populist party since mid-2017, when he replaced founder  Timo Soini , who left to form a splinter group which has since collapsed. The Finns Party has been in opposition since then,  leading public opinion polls  for most of this year. In 2012, Halla-aho was convicted of  inciting hatred  against an ethnic group. \n Andersson, 32, has led her party since mid-2016, becoming Education Minister this past summer. Her support in this poll rose from 12 percent last spring to 16 percent in October. \n Faring best of the other chairs was former finance minister  Petteri Orpo  of the opposition National Coalition Party, who garnered eight percent support, up from six percent last spring. \n Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  of the SDP was chosen by just six percent of respondents, down from seven percent in April. \n The Centre and Greens have new chairs since then, and the results for the other groups in Parliament were too low to be statistically significant. The USU online survey's margin is estimated to be around three percentage points in either direction."}
{"text": "Politicians in Finland are divided over a new policy position from deputy parliamentary ombudsman  Pasi Pölönen  that states that school celebrations to mark Christmas or the end of the academic year should not be held in churches. \n Finnish schools remain closely linked to the two national religions: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Finnish Orthodox Church, and it is not uncommon for school events to be arranged on their premises. \n The deputy parliamentary ombudsman, who is charged with ensuring that state officials observe the law, said in the policy position that school celebrations should be inclusive, and therefore arranged in a way that all of the pupils can participate, regardless of their beliefs. \n Churches convey religious messages \n The ombudsman also reasoned that holding school functions in churches is problematic because the buildings are intended for religious services and therefore convey religious messages. \n His decision has been received with both criticism and praise in the Finnish Parliament. The Left Alliance and the Greens have commended Pölönen's recommendation, but representatives of the Centre, Finns and National Coalition parties (NCP) have denounced his position. \n NCP chair  Petteri Orpo  and Centre Party chair  Katri Kulmuni  were quick to comment, arguing that churches should remain an alternative venue for school events. \n Centre Party MP and constitutional law committee member  Markus Lohi  said that the deputy ombudsman's decision directly contradicted the committee's unanimous decision from 2014. He also noted that holding a school function in a church does not automatically make the event religious. \n NCP: Policy should be made clearer \n In a joint statement, NCP members of the parliamentary constitutional law committee  Wille Rydman  and  Heikki Vestman  said that Pölönen's decision is \"at least in tension\" with the committee's earlier interpretation. The conservative party MPs asked the committee to clarify the situation. \n In his blog, Rydman goes into greater detail about his take on the issue. The MP said that in his opinion, the deputy parliamentary ombudsman's decision seems to have been based more on the wording of the Basic Education Decree, and not on what the constitutional committee had ruled. \n \"This is quite problematic, especially since the parliamentary constitutional law committee has its own stridently-worded recommendation. This was largely necessary because the position of the ombudsmen had diverged from the view of the committee. Now we find ourselves in the same situation,\" Rydman said. \n The deputy parliamentary ombudsman's policy position has also led to consternation among nationalist Finns Party parliamentarians. \n Committee expected to disagree \n The Finnish Parliament's constitutional law committee will likely have to take a position on the deputy ombudsman's position in the near future. The last time the committee presented its interpretation of the matter dates back to 2014, in connection with the Chancellor of Justice's report from that year. \n The Chancellor of Justice's annual report from 2018 is still on the committee's desk, awaiting consideration, as budget negotiations pushed it off the agenda. There has been no time to hear any expert testimony on the report either. \n The constitutional law committee has not yet discussed the new school celebration guidelines from the deputy ombudsman, but consideration of the 2018 report might provide a good opportunity to do so. \n The committee's report on the ombudsman office's annual report was completed in October, before the new policy position from deputy Pölönen was released. \n MPs will debate the 2018 ombudsman report on Wednesday evening in parliament, and the school celebration venue issue is expected to come up in debate."}
{"text": "After years of negotiations and planning in the Sámi Parliament, the Finnish government has agreed to the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) for Sámi peoples in Finland. \n When formed, the independent five-member commission will closely investigate the historical background of what the indigenous inhabitants of Lapland consider the decades-long oppression of the Sámi peoples at the hands of the Finnish government. \n On Wednesday the government held an evening meeting to discuss the mandate prepared for the coming commission. The government concluded that the designation process for the commission could now begin. \n The Finnish government has prepared the commission's mandate throughout 2019 together with the Sámi Parliament and the Skolt Sámi village meetings. The TRC designation and strategy process will begin once the mandate has been reviewed by both Sámi assemblies in December, the government announced. \n Years of work pay off \n Sámi Parliament chair  Tiina Sanila-Aikio  said she considers the government's decision to be a significant step in the formation of the commission, after waiting a long time for a concrete response. \n Story continues after photo. \n Sámi Parliament chair Tiina Sanila-Aikio said the final report is years away. Vesa Toppari / Yle \n \"We started work on the commission almost four years ago, when the formation of the TRC was first logged in our Parliament's strategy,\" said Sanila-Aikio. \"After many hearings and meetings, this is the first official step.\" \n Skolt Sámi representative  Veikko Feodoroff  echoed the sentiment. \n \"This is an important issue. We've worked very hard to get the commission off the ground in Finland.\" \n After government adjourned on Wednesday Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo  went on social media to say she was pleased that the TRC process has taken a step forward. \n She said that Finland must take responsibility for the wrongs of the past. \n Story continues after photo. \n Minister of the Interior Maria Ohisalo said the Sámi Parliament's work has been \"invaluable\". Laura Kotila/valtioneuvoston kanslia \n \"Sámi people have had a weak status in Finland in many ways. The government has not respected Sámi land rights, and Sámi people were forced to integrate into Finnish culture all the way up to the 1970s. Finland has been scorned by international groups concerning its treatment of the Sámi, even in recent years,\" Ohisalo said. \n The goal of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to investigate the extent of the Finnish government's responsibility in committing historical atrocities, and to find a way to reconcile those wrongs by dealing with the facts of the past. \n \"The Sámi Parliament and many Sámi activists have had to work very hard to make this commission a reality. Their work has been invaluable.\" \n Psychological support an ethical prerequisite \n The Finnish government held a total of 29 TRC hearings across the Sámi region and in various Finnish cities in 2018. A total of 300 Sámi people took part in these talks in person or via email, representing some 2.5 percent of Finland's Sámi minority. \n Sanila-Aikio said that the commission's work will take years before completion. \n \"It's hard to know in advance how long the proper hearings and interviews will last. The commission must gather all relevant information and listen to Sámi people's experiences. We also need to scrutinise the part that the government and the authorities have played in Sámi history. It will be a couple of years at least until we have a final report,\" Sanila-Aikio said. \n The TRC will likely deal with sensitive issues and traumatic experiences among Europe's northernmost indigenous peoples. That is why organising a psychological and social support structure has been one of the conditions of the commission's founding. \n \"We do not have culturally sensitive Sámi-language mental health services in Finland. The experts we have spoken to have strongly emphasised that psycho-social support must be guaranteed for the process to be ethical,\" Sanila-Aikio said."}

These  weekly sessions  are an opportunity for legislators to put questions to the government about its policy on current topics. \n The Finns Party has only on two occasions last month—3 and 17 October—brought up issues other than immigration. \n As the largest opposition party in Parliament, the Finns Party has the right to pose the first question, which generally leads to a half hour discussion, swallowing half of the 60-minute session. \n The National Coalition Party is the second-largest opposition party after the Finns Party, following  general elections  earlier this year."}
{"text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed scepticism about the Finnish government's goal of attaining a balanced budget during its four-year legislative term. \n \"The government plans to make the budget balance by 2023, in large part by boosting employment. But our view of likely growth and employment indicates the government would still have to borrow about one percent of GDP in 2023,\" the IMF said in its report on the Finnish economy. \n Prime Minister  Antti Rinne 's centre-left cabinet, which took office in June, aims to balance the budget by 2023, despite agreeing on a 2020 budget deficit of two billion euros earlier this autumn. To that end, it intends to create 60,000 new jobs, raising the employment rate to 75 percent from the current 72.8 percent. \n \"Look at leave and home-care benefits\" \n \"Keep your eye on fiscal sustainability. There's a probability, more than likely, that the budget will not be in balance in 2023,\" IMF senior economist and mission head  Alasdair Scott  said on a visit to Helsinki on Tuesday. \n The IMF predicts that the Finnish economy will grow by 1.25 percent this year, rising to 1.5 percent in 2020. Last year it expanded by 1.7 percent. \n \"To boost employment, the government could look at leave and home-care benefits, which generate incentives for women to stay at home, and tax and benefit schedules that mean that some face a financial penalty to work, rather than stay unemployed or out of the workforce,\" the IMF suggested. \n Environmentally harmful subsidies \n The IMF report points out that various kinds of environmentally harmful subsidies, such as those for peat production, add up to 3.5 billion euros a year. Scott urged reconsideration of these, especially since the cabinet has promised that the country will be carbon-neutral by 2035. \n In a statement, Minister of Finance  Mika Lintilä  conceded that the targets in the government agenda will be challenging to attain. \n \"The Government Programme is demanding. It is clear that the cornerstones are a fiscal balance, a restructuring of health and social services and raising of the employment rate. These will not be achieved automatically, but require determined action,\" he said. \n The IMF also applauded the government's recommendation that banks limit the ratio of household debt to income. The Bank of Finland has long expressed concerned about household debt and the fact that housing company loans are making up a growing share of the housing loan market."}
{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat  reports  on Tuesday that talks on resolving the dispute in the postal sector remain deadlocked. \n The talks were close to a resolution on Monday evening but then the two sides moved further apart, meaning that they reconvene on Tuesday at the National Labour Conciliator’s office. \n The issue remains the collective agreement applying to 700 parcel sorting office workers who the national postal company Posti has transferred to a subsidiary, worsening their terms and conditions. \n SDP on slippery slope \n Ilta-Sanomat  looks at  the political background to the strike. As Posti is a state-owned company, it falls under the purview of  Sirpa Paatero , the Minister for State Ownership Steering. \n She had said in parliament that she wasn’t asked about the transfer of the 700 workers to an inferior collective agreement on wages and terms and conditions. \n However Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  had also claimed in parliament that the government had prevented Posti from transferring some 10,000 workers to the lower-pay package. \n The question IS not unreasonably poses is how the government can claim an active role in one case and ignorance in the other. \n It’s an especially thorny issue for Rinne, who previously headed up the Pro trade union, and Paatero, who is also in the union-backed Social Democrat Party. \n No pikkujoulu no party \n The deadlocked dispute  means  widespread disruption to flights as aviation workers continue sympathy action, and some early morning bus services were cancelled in Helsinki as drivers returned to work. \n Maritime workers are also taking action, refusing to join Finnish-flagged vessels and effectively keeping them in port. \n Iltalehti  reports  that this could have been a problem for the Maritime workers union, which is having a Christmas party on a ship on Tuesday. \n Happily for them, however, the ship on which they are partying is an Estonian-flagged vessel and able to continue on its merry way. Until Thursday when, if the dispute is not resolved, foreign-flagged ferries will also be left in port thanks to support action from dockworkers. \n Baltzar case shocks Finland \n Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday  published  an investigation into a theatre company run by  Veijo Baltzar , an internationally renowned Roma cultural figure. \n Reporters spoke to several women who said they were drawn into the Drom theatre company as teenagers through promises of stardom, only to find a controlling atmosphere. \n They described a set up in which teenage girls were brought in to the company and told to flirt with Baltzar, and his favoured young women were required to live at his home. \n One mother told the paper of her struggles to extract her daughter from the situation, and several women corroborated the claims about Baltzar’s  questionable methods . \n Baltzar was arrested last week on suspicion of aggravated human trafficking. \n The story has rumbled on in the press, with senior politicians wondering how they did not know and others arguing that Baltzar hid in plain sight: in the time before #metoo, it seems nobody was listening. \n Paleface goes wobbly \n Finnish rapper  Paleface  (real name  Karri Miettinen ) has a new record out this week, and it’s a little bit different. \n Together with the Lauluvan unioni group he has recorded an album of songs dating from the Finnish sections of the International Workers of the World (IWW) in North America. \n Helsingin Sanomat  reports  the background to the record, which came about when researcher Saijaleena Rantanen discovered a Finnish-language copy of an IWW songbook at Immigration History Research Centre in Minnesota. \n The album, ‘Tie Vapauteen’ or ‘road to freedom’, recalls the politics of Finnish immigrants in the United States and Canada in the early years of the 20th century. \n Many of them joined the anarcho-syndicalist IWW, members of which were colloquially known as ‘wobblies’, and published Finnish language newspapers and held Finnish language meetings and dances."}

Paatero said that she had not received or heard about those calls. \n The postal strikes that came close to paralysing Finland this year were sparked by the state-owned postal firm Posti’s decision to reduce the pay of those 700 parcel sorting office workers. \n They did this by transferring them to a different collective agreement than the one covering most Posti staff, and the move threatened to collapse the entire wage-bargaining round. \n Union PAU refused to agree a deal for the company’s 10,000 workers until the fate of those 700 parcel sorters was resolved. \n In the end the dispute became political when Rinne and Paatero made conflicting statements on when they heard about Posti’s plans and how fiercely they were opposed. \n The issue is especially sensitive for the union-backed social democrats in general and Rinne in particular, as he was a trade union leader before he won the leadership of the SDP. \n The dispute was  eventually settled  when Posti agreed to allow the 700 workers to retain their current pay package."}

Niinistö said that there is now more information than ever, but that along with that glut there are also half-truths and straight lies in public discussion. \n \"And if we start heading in that direction, this will become a difficult place to live for everybody,\" said Niinistö. \"Maybe the most concerning thing is the hurtful style of discussion where people also attack individuals. It’s quite a tough spot for the victim.\" \n Niinistö said that everyone should defend discussion and debate in society, but also said that critical debates are important. \n On the menu at this year’s reception are organic treats, including the famous traditional punch. There are also vegan wines on offer alongside tee and a beer brewed using leftover bread. \n Secrets of the ball \n Much of the food comes from small producers in the countryside, but organisers of the number one social event of the year do not reveal their names. \n \"This year we have for the first time a  salmiakki  (salt liquorice) pastry, for instance,\" said head chef  Jyrki Jääskeläinen . \"The sandwich cake also has new fillings, including pike and smoked salmon.\" \n A cappella group Club for Five will perform at the event, alongside singers  Laura Voutilainen  and  Lauri Mikkola  and the Cantores Minores Helsinki Cathedral choir. \n There will be some 1,700 guests at the reception to be hosted by Niinistö and First Lady  Jenni Haukio , including 30 veterans of the Second World War.

{"text": "The leaders of the five government parties are to meet on Sunday evening to discuss the fallout from the Posti labour dispute ahead of a parliamentary challenge in the next few days. \n Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  of the Social Democratic Party has invited the other four party chairs to meet at an undisclosed location at 8.30pm. \n They are to go over the events in the dispute, which has dominated domestic politics this autumn. The crisis has led to the resignation of the minister in charge of overseeing state-owned firms, and even to calls for the resignation of Rinne, a former labour boss. \n On Friday, three of the opposition groups in Parliament filed an interpellation over the government's handling of the Posti dispute. Opposition MPs are expected to grill cabinet ministers over the issue on Tuesday before the government faces a vote of confidence on Wednesday. \n The conservative National Coalition Party, the Christian Democrats and the Movement Now (Liike Nyt) filed the challenge. The largest opposition group, the Finns Party, has criticised the government harshly over the matter but did not co-sign the interpellation. \n Centre and Greens sought clarification \n On Saturday, Minister of Economic Affairs  Katri Kulmuni  called for the cabinet partners to meet as soon as possible to discuss future policy on labour disputes, with more looming in the coming weeks. \n Greens chair and Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo  has also sought further clarification from Rinne. \n There are also two smaller parties in the centre-left coalition, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party. They are led by Education Minister  Li Andersson  and Justice Minister  Anna-Maja Henriksson  respectively. \n The government is just under six months into a planned four-year legislative term. \n On Friday, veteran SDP politician  Sirpa Paatero  stepped down as Minister of Local Government and Ownership Steering after it emerged that she had misled Parliament about her role in the Posti labour dispute. Her replacement has not yet been named. \n The company's plan to shift some 700 employees to a lower-paying contract led to a 17-day strike, which ended on Wednesday as sympathy strikes were set to expand."}
{"text": "The leaders of Finland's five government parties met on Sunday evening to discuss the fallout from the Posti labour dispute ahead of an opposition no-confidence vote later this week. \n According to the nation's largest circulation daily,  Helsingin Sanomat , the gathering of party leaders decide that Social Democrat PM  Antti Rinne  will continue to lead the government \"at least for the time being\". \n In a tersely worded press release late Sunday, the government simply stated that party leaders discussed \"the political situation\" and that the cabinet is preparing to respond to the opposition's interpellation - the first step in a non-confidence vote - on Tuesday. \n According to Helsingin Sanomat, information leaked from Sunday's meeting indicated that the situation within the cabinet is not entirely clear. \n The cabinet will, however, writes HS, have to present a common front before Tuesday. \n Rovaniemi's  Lapin Kansa  reports on three speaking engagements Prime Minister Rinne had in Lapland on Sunday where he conceded that he is under a lot of pressure. \n He declined to say directly if it is possible that the government will collapse. He did say that while the situation has been exaggerated by the media, \"anything is always possible\". \n Tensions in the foreign ministry \n The newsstand tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  reports that Finland's foreign minister,  Pekka Haavisto , ousted his ministry's director of consular services,  Pasi Tuominen , after he tried and failed to pressure him into short circuiting procedure and repatriating the  children of ISIS fighters  from Syria without a political mandate. \n According to the Ilta-Sanomat report, Haavisto also bumped heads with Tuominen who has been relieved of his duties, over visa regulations for Russian citizens. \n Ilta-Sanomat says it has information that a plan was formulated at the Foreign Ministry to repatriate the children of Finnish ISIS members being held at the al-Hol refugee camp. \n The plan was they would come to Finland without their mothers. According to the paper, Foreign Minister Haavisto attempted to convince Tuominen to carry out the plan in his own name and on his own authority. \n Tuominen reportedly replied that as a responsible civil servant, he could not carry out an operation that would violate Finnish law and international agreements. \n In addition, Ilta-Sanomat reports that Haavisto was displeased by changes in tighter visa regulations for Russian citizens introduced this past autumn. Up until this autumn, Finland had a more streamlined visa application process for Russians than in the rest of the Schengen zone. \n The paper describes the atmosphere within the ministry as tense, with growing dissatisfaction with Haavisto who insiders see as bossy and quick to anger. \n Foreign Minister Haavisto declined to answer questions on the details of the Ilta-Sanomat report. \n Chinese language boom \n The  HS Metro  freesheet reports that Chinese is becoming an increasingly popular choice in Finnish schools, enjoying what it says is something of a boom in both elementary and secondary schools. \n Chinese is available to pupils in several elementary schools in Helsinki, Espoo, Turku and Tampere, even as a long-course, or so-called A1 language. \n In addition, close to 20 upper secondary schools offer Chinese language courses. \n The National Agency for Education is  funding a project aimed at increasing Chinese course offerings  nationwide and making it a standard option in school curricula. \n There are challenges in meeting the growing interest in studying this language. One is a lack of qualified teachers. The other is a lack of teaching materials specifically designed for Finnish schoolchildren. \n Holiday taxi rides \n The economic and business daily  Kauppalehti  passes on some advice about using taxis during the holiday season. \n The paper warns that with Independence Day coming up and Christmas parties in full swing, there are likely to be more independent taxi drivers behind the wheel, some of whom will be looking to take advantage of peak demand by charging exorbitant fares. \n Cabonline CEO Kati Rajala, whose company operates taxis under the Kovanen and FixuTaksi brands, advises anyone planning to party and take a taxi to either download an app, or to save the number of a trusted taxi service on their phones. \n By law, anyone using a taxi must be informed before setting off if the ride will cost more than 100 euros. \n Legislation regulating the taxi business  that came into force in 2018 has come in for heavy criticism, and revisions are being considered. \n One idea that is being examined is a requirement for cars to carry some sign that they are licensed for use as taxis. In Sweden, for example, all registered taxis can be identified by the colour of their registry plates. Another possible change may be a requirement that taxi permits be issued only to people with a  commercial tax ID number ."}
{"text": "Finland's International Gender Equality Prize has been awarded to the global non-profit organisation Equality Now as a recognition of its work in tackling gender inequality and changing discriminatory laws around the world. \n The organisation will also receive 300,000 euros from the Finnish government. \n Yasmeen Hassan , Global Executive Director of Equality Now, collected the award on behalf of the organisation at a ceremony in Tampere on Monday afternoon, and thanked the Finnish Government for recognising the importance of gender equality by creating the prize. \n \"Of course we are excited. Women's organisations are small all over the world and often lack the resources. That is why getting such recognition is fantastic,\" Hassan said. \n Equality Now was established in New York in 1992 with the aim of protecting and promoting the rights of women and girls around the world. Currently, the organisation is particularly active in Kenya, where it is trying to reduce child marriages, sexual abuse of women and female genital mutilation. According to Hassan, much work remains to be done. \n \"Equality for women and girls is the solution to some of the biggest challenges the world is facing today – peace and security, poverty eradication and climate change,\" Hassan said. \"In addition to being the right and just thing to do, it is also the smartest investment for humanity.\" \n Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  had originally been due to hand over the prize, but he was unable to attend. His place was taken by Finland's Minister for Gender Equality  Thomas Blomqvist . \n According to the organisation's  website , Equality Now is a non-governmental organisation that aims \"to increase awareness of the violations to women's rights that happen every day around the world\". \n 300 submissions from around the world \n During the open nomination period, over 300 proposals from more than 60 countries were submitted for consideration for the award, and the final decision was based on the recommendation of an independent international jury. \n The jury included  Pekka Haavisto , Finland's current Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Eva Biaudet , President of the National Council of Women of Finland,  Katja Iversen , President and CEO of Women Deliver,  Anneli Jäätteenmäki , a former Member of the European Parliament, and  Dean Peacock , Senior Advisor for Global Advocacy at Promundo. \n Haavisto, who chaired the jury, said Equality Now's effectiveness in changing laws and harmful practices around the world was the key to it receiving the award. \n \"The main obstacles for progress in global gender equality are negative attitudes and structures,\" Haavisto said. \"Discriminatory laws and practices still exist in all countries of the world.\" \n In 2017, the International Gender Equality Prize  was awarded to German Chancellor   Angela Merkel .Sherequested that the 150,000-euro prize money be allocated to an anti-domestic violence organisation in Nigeria, which is using the funds to build a shelter for women."}
{"text": "Centre Party MPs have signaled that they were not impressed by explanations offered by Prime Minister  Antti Rinne , following questions over the government’s handling of a labour market dispute involving postal workers and state-owned mail carrier Posti. \n Centre Party chair  Katri Kulmuni  said on Monday afternoon that while the coalition partner is committed to the current government coalition led by Rinne’s Social Democratic Party, there remains a crisis of confidence in the PM. \n \"We have no confidence in the individual [Rinne]. We want the government to be functional and for it to be able to handle national issues,\" Kulmuni told reporters. \n When pressed whether or not this meant that the Centre no longer had confidence in Prime Minister Antti Rinne, Kulmuni responded simply, \"We have no confidence.\" \n The party leader said that the party leadership would meet on Monday evening to consider the matter. Kulmuni stressed that the Centre is still committed to the government’s composition and programme. \n Her colleague  Antti Kurvinen , chair of the Centre’s parliamentary group told reporters that Rinne’s account of the government’s actions in the labour market dispute were found wanting. \n \"The explanations given yesterday were not adequate,\" Kurvinen declared. \n Questions over what govt knew -- and when \n Party  meetings began on Sunday  and spilled over into Monday as government partners met to discuss the fallout between an apparent standoff between the lead government partner, the Social Democratic Party, and senior Posti leadership over the fate of 700 parcel sorting workers who had previously been transferred to lower-paid employment contracts. \n PAU, the union representing postal and logistical workers, had embarked on a 17-day strike over the treatment of the 700 workers as well as over a new collective bargaining agreement. The industrial action ended last Wednesday when  both sides reached a settlement . \n The apparent crisis of confidence over the prime minister’s leadership turned on what the government knew about the plan and when. The government -- and Rinne -- stressed that it had not been told in advance of the new contract arrangements for the affected workers. \n Posti board chairman  Markku Pohjola  was equally adamant that the minister responsible for state enterprise ownership and steering,  Sirpa Paatero , was in the know. Paatero  eventually resigned on Friday  over her role in managing the dispute. \n Backing from Greens, SPP holds steady \n On Monday, the Swedish People’s Party met and decided that Rinne should be given a second chance, according to party chair and Justice Minister  Anna-Maja Henriksson . \"We need stability now. None of us is perfect. In this situation the SPP supports Prime Minister Rinne, but I hope that there will be further discussion within the government,\" Henriksson said. \n The minister noted that the government should no longer intervene in labour market disputes. \n \"Our view is that the Posti matter was not managed as well we would have hoped. There have been communication problems and it should be more accurate,\" she added. \n Coalition partners had previously called on Rinne to give a detailed account of the circumstances leading up to the current situation, especially the Posti drama. On Monday morning, the PM told news agency STT that he had no comment to offer on the situation at that time. \n On Tuesday the government will answer an interpellation on the matter tabled by opposition parties the National Coalition Party, the Christian Democrats and Movement Now. The interpellation will be followed by a confidence vote in the government on Wednesday. \n Meanwhile the Chancellor of Justice has reportedly received several complaints about the PM’s conduct during the postal workers’ dispute."}
{"text": "Social Democratic Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  told the newspaper  Helsingin Sanomat  late Monday night that he wants to see a written statement from the Centre Party on Tuesday, laying out the reasons it  no longer has confidence in him  to lead the five-party coalition government. \n \"Only then, when I have received a detailed written answer from the Centre, will I be able to determine what I will do,\" Rinne said in a telephone interview. \n The Centre Party's parliamentary group and party leadership on Monday announced they had lost confidence in the PM. In his interview with Helsingin Sanomat, Rinne slammed the Centre for being too vague about its intentions. \n \"If I am accused of poor communication, it has to be said that the Centre has at very least set a new national record for a lack of clarity in this matter. I demand an unequivocal yes or no about whether or not we continue together, not just as political parties, but also as individuals.\" \n Rinne declined to discuss whether or not he and his Social Democratic Party still trust the Centre and its chair  Katri Kulmuni , simply stating that up until now the SDP has had no complaints about its coalition partners. \n Asked if he will turn in his resignation on Tuesday, if the Centre presents clear and detailed reasons for a lack of confidence in him, Rinne gave no definitive answer. \n \"As I said, there must be concrete and unequivocal reasons why they feel they have no confidence in the prime minister.\" \n \"Resign or government falls\" \n The newsstand tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  was among the papers reporting that there is building pressure within the Centre Party to oust Rinne from the premiership. \n Centre Party leader Kulmuni on Monday evening did not call for Rinne's resignation, but did say that Centre Party members were not \"completely convinced\" by Rinne's explanation of events surrounding the recent Posti labour dispute, and that the Social Democratic Party should draw its own conclusions now. \n Ilta-Sanomat presented statements from three Centre Party MPs who were more straightforward on the condition of anonymity. \n The verdict of all three was that the prime minister should resign before a scheduled debate in parliament at 2pm this afternoon. \n \"There has been an attempt to be considerate. It is quite clear that there is no going back now - either Rinne resigns, or Rinne fights and the government falls,\" said one MP. \n Another of the centre MPs interviewed stated that there was no desire to \"publically butcher\" the prime minister. \n \"It has been attempted to get the message across both privately and publicly. His reaction shows something about his capacity to read the situation.\" \n The third told Ilta-Sanomat that the Centre Party strongly believes in the composition of the current coalition government and in its programme, but that it has ”the wrong skipper”. \n Haavisto denies repatriation plan \n Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto , a member of Finland’s Green League, has denied a Monday  report in the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat  claiming that he ousted a top ministry civil servant from his post for refusing to take part in a plan to repatriate children of Finnish ISIS fighters being held in the al-Hol camp in Syria. \n Turku's  Turun Sanomat  reports that later on Monday parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee asked for an explanation about the claim and Christian Democrat MP Sari Essayah filed a formal written question to be answered by the government. \n Haavisto not only denied that he had pressured the ministry official, he told the media that no such plan ever existed. \n \"The mysterious plan in the news is a mystery to me, too. I was not involved in preparing such a plan, nor am I aware that ministry officials would have prepared such a plan,\" stated Haavisto. \n He added that the idea itself seems strange considering that the Kurdish administration in the area does not allow families to be split up and does not allow children to travel alone. \n Commenting on the claim that he had lost his temper with the head of the ministry's consular section over the matter, Haavisto said simply, \"I'm not the short-tempered type.\" \n Yes to Roma, no to Pride \n Lapin Kansa  reports that the city council of Rovaniemi voted on Monday to start the practice of flying the flag of the Roma people on city buildings on International Romani Day, April 8th. \n At the same meeting a motion that would have also seen the rainbow flag of the sexual minorities' movement on city buildings on national Pride Day and Arctic Pride Day was narrowly defeated. In Lapin Kansa's words, \"the rainbow flags will stay in the closet\". \n Late last month, the LGBT rights organisation SETA announced that the Arctic Pride event that has been held annually in Rovaniemi since 2013 will not take place next year. The local SETA chapter said that it has been unable to recruit enough volunteers to organize the event in 2020, but hopes it will be possible again the following year. \n Heat wave coming \n Iltalehti 's definition of \"heat wave\" may not be everyone's, but the paper was excited enough about a forecast of rising temperatures this week to throw an exclamation mark into its headline. \n Temperatures on Thursday and Friday this week are likely to be well above freezing again, even in Finnish Lapland. \n The paper quotes Foreca meteorologist  Ilkka Alanko  as saying that on Friday, Independence Day, temperatures along the south coast will be 5C-6C and in central regions 2C-4C. \n This warmer weather, combined with rain, will mean that at least in the south of Finland the present snow cover will melt away. \n For those hankering after a white Christmas, the good news is that the \"heat wave\" will be short-lived. Temperatures will fall after the weekend and Finland, including southern areas, may get its snow back well before the holidays."}

In September,  Katri Kulmuni  took over as Centre chair from the previous prime minister,  Juha Sipilä . She also holds the posts of Minister of Economic Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister. \n Halla-aho's populists leap to top of the chart \n The Kantar TNS tracking poll was carried out in the first half of November, while the Posti strike was underway.

It was in first place before last spring's parliamentary election, which it won by a narrow margin. \n Now it has been surpassed by the nationalist Finns Party, government partners the Greens and the other main opposition group, the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP). \n The Finns Party, led by immigration hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho , leapt from fifth place to the top of the chart, for the first time since 2010. \n The Centre meanwhile slid to the bottom of the list, with the Greens the only government party to see an improvement in its public image.

{"text": "Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  has resigned in the face of a parliamentary challenge that was to have begun on Tuesday afternoon. \n Rinne said at noon on Tuesday that he would tender his resignation to President  Sauli Niinistö , two hours before MPs were to begin debating an interpellation filed by opposition parties. \n Just over half an hour later, Niinistö accepted Rinne's resignation at the presidential residence, Mäntyniemi. \n That meant that Rinne's cabinet had formally resigned and would continue on as a caretaker government. \n Current coalition likely to continue \n On Tuesday afternoon Speaker of Parliament  Matti Vanhanen , a former Centre Party prime minister, urged \"the old government coalition to carry matters forward.\" \n The current five-party government looks likely to carry on after a cabinet reshuffle. \n The SDP's main coalition partner, the Centre, which triggered the crisis by expressing doubt in Rinne, is unlikely to want new elections. The nationalist Finns Party, the second-largest group in Parliament, has seen  rising popularity . \n However its chair,  Jussi Halla-aho , said on Tuesday afternoon that he did \"not see re-thinking the makeup of the government as the primary alternative\". \n The political upheaval comes as Finland wraps up its six-month  presidency of the European Council . A two-day EU summit begins in Brussels on Thursday next week. \n Rapid sequence of events \n Rinne's five-party centre-left coalition took office just under six months ago after his Social Democratic Party (SDP) won April's parliamentary election  by a whisker . \n Events have proceeded quickly since the SDP minister in charge of overseeing state-owned firms,  Sirpa Paatero ,  resigned on Friday . \n That came amid revelations that she knew in advance of the postal company's plans to shift some workers to a lower-paying contract, and misled MPs about it. Since then, there have been indications that former union boss Rinne, too, knew of the plan and tacitly approved it in August, before a  protracted postal strike  this autumn. \n Late Sunday evening, the five government party chairs held a crisis meeting. On Monday, the Centre expressed a lack of confidence in Rinne in a vaguely-worded statement. On Monday evening, Rinne declined to step down, instead demanding further clarification from the Centre. \n All eyes on Sanna Marin \n According to Yle sources, Rinne decided to wait for the Centre to directly call for his resignation. The tabloid Iltalehti reported that he and the SDP demanded that Centre chair  Katri Kulmuni  provide details in writing as to why the premier should be replaced. \n Story continues after photo \n Minister of Transport and Communications Sanna Marin Jussi Nukari / Lehtikuva \n Rinne and Kulmuni met in the late morning at the Council of State building. \n Meanwhile SDP deputy chair  Sanna Marin , who led the party during Rinne's  extended sick leave  last winter, rushed back from a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. \n Speaking to reporters on arrival at Helsinki Airport around 11.30am, Marin said she would \"not shirk her responsibility in this difficult situation.\" \n Iltalehti says Marin is to lead attempts to form a new government. Marin, 34, a second-term MP from Tampere, has been Minister of Transport and Communications  since June . \n If she takes over, she would be the youngest prime minister in Finnish history. The Centre's'  Esko Aho  was 36 when he took office in 1991. \n The leader of the SDP's parliamentary group,  Antti Lindtman , 37, also said he would be ready to become prime minister. \n Asked at his post-resignation press conference about the name of a probable successor, Rinne declined to speculate, saying only that \"We have many people who are competent to do the prime minister's job.” \n He also announced that he plans to continue as SDP chair and to seek reelection to the post at next summer's party congress."}
{"text": "A majority of MPs on parliament’s foreign affairs committee have voted to clear foreign minister  Pekka Haavisto  of alleged wrongdoing in a plan to repatriate  Finnish nationals currently at a refugee camp in Syria . \n On Tuesday morning Haavisto appeared before the committee to explain his ministry’s actions with respect to Finns living at the al-Hol refugee camp. On Monday, the minister revealed that the ministry had been looking at different options for repatriating the wives and children of fighters for the extremist group Isis. \n Haavisto refuted  allegations reported by the tabloid daily Ilta-Sanomat  that he had sidelined consular head  Pasi Tuominen  from the repatriation project. He said that Tuominen will continue in his role, but noted that he had assigned a separate official to handle the al-Hol case. \n Committee chair: MPs kept in the dark \n After Haavisto delivered his account of events, the committee voted on whether or not to accept the minister’s explanation -- a majority accepted his version of events. \n Chair of the foreign affairs committee,  Mika Niikko  said that the Finns Party held the view that the committee had not been given timely information about the ministry’s efforts to repatriate the Finnish women and children to Finland. \n Niikko said that the last time the committee had been briefed on the matter, there was no mention that another civil servant had been assigned to the project. He added that the committee had the impression that people would receive support if they independently sought consular assistance. \n The committee chair charged that MPs had been kept in the dark, even as the president and the government had been informed about the project. \n Haavisto said that the repatriation project was not a government initiative, but that it originated from official duty as well as a response from the Chancellor of Justice to complaints made about the issue in October."}
{"text": "Tuesday’s big news was  the departure of Prime Minister  Antti Rinne . \n His hand was eventually forced over his failure to adequately explain how and why he and his SDP colleague and Minister for State Ownership Steering  Sirpa Paatero  had handled  a plan to lower pay for 700 postal workers . \n The ex-union boss was premier for six months, first  establishing and then leading a coalition of five parties  but it was one of those parties — the Centre — that eventually did for him. \n What’s ‘Appening \n Iltalehti has a  detailed story  based on a groupchat of Centre Party MPs suggesting that Rinne’s fate was sealed on Friday evening after Posti published a statement suggesting the government had been informed about their pay reduction plan. \n By that point, Paatero had already  resigned as the minister who had been in charge of managing contacts with Posti . \n IL reports that Paatero’s scalp wasn’t enough for Centre MPs from ‘revivalist movement and business’ backgrounds, referencing the twin pillars of Centre support among rural entrepreneurs and Laestadian Lutheran groups. \n Business leaders in the Centre Party have been uncomfortable, according to IL, with a PM who had such a strong trade union background. \n Revenge in mind \n Messages seen by the paper include one from ex-PM  Juha Sipilä , sent on Friday in response to other MPs saying their party faithful out in the provinces were unhappy with Rinne. \n \"Yep, that’s all I’ve heard too. Are we having a parliamentary group meeting before the confidence vote debate?\" \n Other MPs chimed in and even those cautious about getting rid of the premier were suggesting that more explanations were needed if the party was to lend Rinne its support this week. \n Publicity-hungry Lapland MP  Mikko Kärnä  chimed in to suggest supporting SDP MP  Antti Lindtman  as an alternative, as revenge for the 2003 machinations when the SDP had lost confidence in and sought the resignation of Centre PM  Anneli Jäätteenmäki . \n \"Give the job to Lindtman. Remember [the] Jäätteenmäki [affair],\" said Kärnä. \n In terms of entertainment, IL clearly beat tabloid rival Ilta-Sanomat which  published the historic but rather dry email  in which Centre group chair  Antti Kurvainen  officially told Rinne that the Centre Party did not have confidence in his leadership. \n The email was sent on Tuesday at 10:29, shortly before Rinne said his goodbyes to the SDP parliamentary group and went to see the president to submit his resignation. \n SDP direction change? \n HS  looks at  the new premier, who is likely to be appointed next week. The two candidates are Antti Lindtman, the 37-year-old Uusimaa MP who heads up the SDP’s parliamentary caucus, and  Sanna Marin , the Transport Minister from Tampere who at 34 would be Finland’s youngest-ever Prime Minister. \n The two options represent clearly divergent paths, according to HS reporter  Marko Junkkari . He characterises Marin as an idealist and Lindtman as an realist, outlining the difference in approach as follows: \n \"In Marin’s opinion it would be good if the SDP’s election programme included a ban on internal combustion engines. Lindtman might be of the same opinion but he certainly wouldn’t write it in the election manifesto.\" \n Marin has the support of Rinne, with whom Lindtman’s relations have been 'cool', according to HS. whether Rinne’s support is an advantage or disadvantage remains to be seen, as the party meets next week. \n Lindtman's ability to work with parties to the right of the SDP would be greater than Marin's according to Junkkari. Under Marin, therefore, there would be a greater chance of a red-green 'block' developing in Finland, in which left-of-centre parties work together and broader coalitions rare, as is the case in Sweden."}
{"text": "The Finnish political scene is in turmoil after Prime Minister  Antti Rinne   stepped down after just six months  on the job, so in a special edition of All Points North we asked Yle political journalist  Katri Makkonen  what just happened and what might come next. \n There is now a two-horse race to succeed Rinne as the next SDP Prime Minister, with the party board due to meet on Sunday. \n \"It's a long time until Sunday and anything can happen,\" Makkonen said. \n The two main contenders for the position are current Transport and Communications Minister,  Sanna Marin , and chair of the SDP parliamentary group,  Antti Lindtman . Rinne left office under a cloud after the SDP's coalition partner  the Centre Party said it had no confidence in him  after questions arose about his role in a labour market dispute. \n Unanswered questions \n According to Makkonen, Rinne isn't the only one who hasn't explained himself adequately. The Centre Party have also left open questions about exactly why they declared a loss of confidence in the PM. Makkonen drew a parallel to two years ago when the Centre's  Juha Sipilä -led government  splintered and reformulated itself  in a way that many saw as undemocratic. \n \"One could say that this somehow was not very democratic either, to throw out a prime minister without stating very clear reasons why this had to happen. They just said that there is no more confidence towards him [Rinne] but have yet to explain themselves better,\" Makkonen pointed out. \n The veteran journalist noted that the APN audience are not the only ones still scratching their head over the current political drama -- Finns are also perplexed by the ongoing theatre. \n \"Even Finnish people don't know what's going on.

{"text": "\"Marin leads with ministerial experience,\" is the leader headline in main daily Helsingin Sanomat (HS) , which goes on in its editorial to outline the reasons that  Sanna Marin , 34, will likely become Finland’s next prime minister. This follows in the wake of former PM  Antti Rinne ’s dramatic resignation on Tuesday following the fallout from the postal workers' recent industrial action. \n \"Marin is the favourite as the next SDP prime ministerial candidate,\" writes HS, citing its own poll carried out on Tuesday evening. \"Thirty percent of respondents supported Minister of Transport and Communications Marin, while MP and Social Democratic Parliamentary group chair  Antti Lindtman  received only 12 percent support.\" \n HS writes that Marin is former PM Rinne’s choice of the two potential candidates. Marin also has previous party chair experience, as she took over for Rinne when he was on sick leave last winter. \n HS goes onto say that while Lindtman is only 37, voters may feel that he’s long been in politics although in reality this is only his third term as an MP. A schism arose between Rinne and Lindtman during the 2017 SDP party political conference, when there were suggestions that Lindtman would challenge Rinne’s position as chair, but that didn’t happen. \n Furthermore, writes HS, last spring Rinne offered Lindtman the Labour Minister portfolio, which Lindtman turned down. This is an issue that will no doubt arise in the contest for the prime ministerial role. \n HS concludes in its editorial that the competition is down to the fine line between an experienced minister and an ungrateful political portfolio rejector. \n He shoots, he scores \n The  Iltalehti tabloid's sports pages lead with a story about Finnish Chicago Bulls basketball player Lauri Markkanen ,who scored 15 points and five rebounds on Wednesday night in an NBA tournament game against the Memphis Grizzlies, with a final winning score for the Bulls of 106-99. \n “Now this feels good!” said Markkanen in an interview with American TV network NBC News. \n This is the first time this season that the Chicago team is on a winning streak, having won two games in a row. \n Slippery weather in store \n Ilta-Sanomat (IS), the sister tabloid of HS, warns readers that sidewalks throughout the country are very slippery this morning as the Finnish Meteorological Institute has issued a warning about poor pedestrian conditions  throughout Finland with the exception of Lapland. \n Freezing temperatures overnight have turned water-covered icy patches into slick skating rinks. \n Correction: This story was amended to reflect that Sanna Marin has party chair experience (not prime ministerial experience), as she took over for Rinne when he was on sick leave last winter."}
{"text": "The rising popularity of the Finns Party shows no signs of slackening. The largest opposition party has extended its lead over its closest rival to 5.7 percentage points. In second is the other main opposition group, the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP). \n The Yle/Taloustutkimus tracking poll suggests that 24.3 percent of voters would back the Finns Party if an election were held now. This is the strongest support level in the nearly quarter of a century since the party was founded. \n Its previous peak of popularity was in 2011, when it had 23 percent support under former chair and co-founder  Timo Soini . Since mid-2017, the party has been led by immigration hardliner  Jussi Halla-aho . \n Story continues after photos \n Opposition leaders Jussi Halla-aho (Finns Party) and  Petteri Orpo (NCP). \n Tuomo Turja , research director at pollster Taloustutkimus, tells Yle that the party is gathering support from both the politically disaffected and previous supporters of the government parties. \n \"The Finns Party is gaining supporters from the Centre, the SDP and those who have been previously undecided, in other words, people who aren't very engaged with politics,\" Turja says. \n On Tuesday, the final day covered by this poll, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  Antti Rinne , stepped down as prime minister. After less than six months in office, his five-party centre-left coalition became a caretaker government pending the naming of a new prime minister and talks on re-forming the coalition. \n NCP begins to recover \n The NCP also seems to be benefiting from being in opposition. The pro-business, pro-Nato group's popularity has edged up to 18.6 percent since last spring's parliamentary election, when it scored 17 percent support. \n Story continues after photo \n Centre chair Katri Kulmuni Mikko Stig / Lehtikuva \n The SDP sees its backing decline to 13.2 percent, compared to 17.7 percent in the election. \n Suffering the worst losses among the government partners is the Centre, which led the previous government. Despite choosing a new leader in the early autumn, the party sees its support slump by 2.3 percentage points to 10.6 percent. That's the lowest ever in its 113-year history. \n \"The biggest beneficiary has been the Finns Party, but the Centre is also increasingly leaking support to the NCP. There is also a significant bloc of previous Centre voters who have now increasingly withdrawn to the sidelines,\" observes Turja. \n Government parties support at 50% \n The five government parties had the combined support of half of respondents. The most popular of them at the moment appears to be the Greens at 13.9 percent, dipping slightly in recent months. \n Story continues after photo \n Left Alliance chair Li Andersson Akseli Muraja / Lehtikuva \n Of the government parties, only the Left Alliance saw a rise in popularity last month, nudging up half a percentage point to 8.4 percent. \n There were no significant changes in support for the small parties, which all scored below four percent. \n Between 11 November and 3 December, Taloustutkimus interviewed nearly 3,000 people, of whom just over 2,000 expressed a party preference. It estimates the margin of error at 1.8 percentage points."}
{"text": "Finland's new five-party coalition government, headed by SDP Prime Minister  Sanna Marin , hit its first serious bump on Wednesday when opposition parties in parliament filed a motion leading to a vote of no-confidence over  the repatriation of Finnish citizens currently in the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria . \n The motion, initiated by the Finns Party, gained the backing of the Christian Democrats late Tuesday and of the National Coalition Party (NCP) on Wednesday morning. It is also being supported by the sole MP of the Movement Now (Liike nyt) group. \n At a press conference Wednesday morning, opposition Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  questioned whether Finland has an obligation to aid the women and children of Isis fighters. He did concede, however, that Finnish citizens always have the right to return to the country. \n \"This is a question of the adult women. They are a concrete security risk to Finland. Once back in Finland they could continue their terrorist activities,\" Halla-aho stated. \n Halla-aho added that he wants to know if Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  has supplied accurate information on the issue. \n \"Recently we've seen a disconcerting cat and mouse game. In terms of parliamentary oversight, the situation has been unbearable,\" said Halla-aho. \"Are Isis families being brought to Finland? Have parliament and the media been misled?\" \n Backing from NCP \n The second main opposition party, the NCP decided Wednesday to back a vote of no-confidence in the government. Its parliamentary group leader, MP  Kai Mykkänen  challenged the new prime minister, Sanna Marin, to shoulder responsibility. \n \"You cannot avoid responsibility. Hopefully the government understands now that this is a serious matter,\" said Mykkänen. \n \"There is now great uncertainty whether or not the government has made a political decision and issued a mandate to repatriate Finnish citizens who took part in the operations of the Isis caliphate,\" Kai Mykkänen stated in parliament. \n The leader of the Christian Democratic Party's parliamentary group,  Päivi Räsänen , echoed a Finnish Security Intelligence Service evaluation that the women in the al-Hol camp would be a security risk. Räsänen did say she would be ready to help the children, though. \n \"However, a clear political decision must be made, without hiding being the backs of civil servants,\" Räsänen continued. \n The NCP's Mykkänen was also in favour of aiding the children, if a way can be found to do so without compromising security. \n According to Mykkänen the government's statements on the issue have been evasive and those by Foreign Minister Haavisto have been contradictory. \n The NCP's position is that a political decision by the government is required if Finnish citizens in the al-Hol camp are to be actively assisted in returning to the country. \n \"If this does not conform to the normal operations based on the law on consular services, but rather on exceptional action, then of course the government must make a political decision. It is extremely corny that apparently an effort has been made to pressure a foreign ministry official to act illegally, without the government's mandate,\" said Mykkänen."}
{"text": "The board of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has proposed that party chair and caretaker Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  lead negotiations on forming a new government – a cabinet that would be led by someone else. The party's parliamentary group is to decide on the issue on Thursday afternoon. \n The opposition, particularly the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) has criticised the choice of Rinne to assemble a new cabinet, as he was ousted from the premiership earlier this week. \n That came after the second-largest government partner, the Centre, expressed a vaguely-worded lack of confidence in him. Rinne  resigned as PM  on Tuesday but said he intended to carry on as party chair and MP. \n \"In historical terms, it's in no way exceptional that a departing prime minister, the speaker of Parliament or another corresponding person would lead talks on forming a new government,\" SDP party secretary  Antton Rönnholm  told Yle. \n Rönnholm said the Centre Party has in no way sought to influence the choice of who will try to form a government. He said he expects the Centre to work to build trust between the government parties. \n PM candidate to be chosen on Sunday \n On Thursday, the SDP board also decided that the larger party council will choose a prime ministerial candidate on Sunday evening. \n So far two politicians have said they would be interested in the post: Minister of Transport and Communications  Sanna Marin , who is the deputy party chair and a  former acting party chair , and  Antti Lindtman , leader of the SDP parliamentary group. \n An Yle straw poll of SDP council members on Wednesday gave Marin a narrow lead, with 20 councillors supporting her versus 14 for Lindtman. However 20 others said they had not decided yet, and seven could not be reached. \n The parties aim to carry out government talks before choosing a new prime ministerial candidate. Eventually the premier will be elected by Parliament and appointed by the president. \n Both Marin and Lindtman have said they do not think it would be fair for either of them to be named to form a new government at this stage. Centre politicians said on Wednesday that they were not opposed to having Rinne lead negotiations. \n Friday would have marked the end of the Rinne government's first six months in office."}

{"text": "Finland’s newspapers are dominated by one story: the selection of  Sanna Marin  by the Social Democratic Party Council  to be the next Prime Minister . \n Helsingin Sanomat writes that Marin’s slim victory over  Antti Lindtman  at the council meeting on Sunday night means  the Finnish government is now run by five women  - four of whom are under 35. \n If Marin also becomes the chair of her party — and she has indicated that she intends to challenge outgoing Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  for the position — then all five parties in the coalition government would be chaired by women, HS writes. \n Alongside Marin as Prime Minister will be the 32-year-old leader of the Centre Party and Minister of Economic Affairs  Katri Kulmuni  — who has now been named to become Finance Minister, 34-year-old  Maria Ohisalo,  who heads up the Green Party and serves as Interior Minister, 32-year-old Left Alliance chair and Minister of Education  Li Andersson , and 55-year-old Swedish People’s Party leader and Minister of Justice  Anna-Maja Henriksson . \n HS’s sister tabloid Ilta-Sanomat has a  profile piece  on the new PM — as do many other papers — to introduce the \"relatively unknown\" Marin to their readers. \n The paper speaks to a number of Marin’s former colleagues and the comments range from very positive: \"she is smart and quick to learn\", according to a former colleague on the Tampere city council, to very critical: \"intense green left-wing freak\", from a source who did not wish to be named, IS writes. \n The paper also notes that the \"calm and restrained\" Marin can show a tougher side too, as evidenced during a famous  Tampere city council meeting  (video with English subtitles) in 2016 when she became increasingly exasperated at the behaviour of some of her tram-sceptical council colleagues as they filibustered the debate. \n Paatero's long week \n The old adage, usually attributed to former British Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , that a \"week is a long time in politics\" is certainly true for  Sirpa Paatero . \n Tabloid Iltalehti  writes that the former Minister for State Ownership Steering , who resigned on November 29 after providing confusing answers about what she knew and when in relation to national mail carrier Posti’s plans to  cut the pay of 700 workers , is now back in politics as Finland’s Minister of Local Government. \n The tabloid explains that although Paatero tended her resignation to Rinne and went on sick leave, the resignation was not processed before Rinne himself resigned on December 3. \n \"Well, yes, I have to admit, it's been quite a tough week,\" Paatero told the paper, adding that she is \"of course delighted and really taken with confidence\" that she figures in Marin’s future plans. \n 100,000 start strike \n Turku-based daily Turun Sanomat reports on a  planned strike by as many as 100,000 workers  that began on Monday morning. The strike, one of the largest in recent years, will see workers attached to the Industrial Union, Trade Union Pro and the Federation of Professional and Managerial Staff YTN down tools for the next three days. \n This includes workers involved in fuel production, pharmaceutical companies, mines and several technology companies. \n The paper writes that the strike is unlikely to have an impact on the lives of ordinary citizens in the short term but if it were to be prolonged, it may impact the availability of some medicines and the distribution of heating oil. \n The paper also quotes  Minna Helle , labour market director at the Federation of Finnish Technology Industries, who believes the strike will have a detrimental effect on Finnish exports over the coming days. \n \"There is little awareness among international customers that products will not be delivered due to the strike. This poses a threat to customer relationships and Finland's reputation,\" Helle said. \n In response to her comments,  Riku Aalto , president of the Confederation of Finnish Industries, said that employer representative always try to paint \"gloomy clouds\" in these situations."}
{"text": "When Finland's parliament votes in the next few days on the Social Democratic Party's nomination of  Sanna Marin  as prime minister, the 34-year-old current Minister of Transport and Communications is likely to become the world's youngest serving head of government. \n Currently that title is held by the 35-year-old Ukrainian Prime Minister  Oleksiy Honcharuk , who took office in May. \n Marin will also become the youngest prime minister in Finnish history, as she is two years younger than the Centre Party's  Esko Aho , who became prime minister in April 1991 at the age of 36. \n Marin was asked a question about her age as soon as the result of the vote was announced at the Social Democratic Party Council in Helsinki on Sunday evening. \n \"I will respond in the same way as before. I have not actually ever thought about my age or my gender, I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate,\" Marin said. \n There is no official list of the youngest Heads of State or Prime Ministers, but after Marin and Honcharuk, the list of the next youngest includes North Korean leader  Kim Jong-Un  (36), El Salvador President  Nayib Bukele  (38) and New Zealand Prime Minister  Jacinda Ardern  (39). \n Marin's coalition partners all led by women \n Marin's coalition partners in Finland’s five-party government are all led by women - four of whom are under 35 years of age; 32-year-old current Minister of Economic Affairs -- and soon-to-be Minister of Finance --  Katri Kulmuni  is the leader of the Centre Party, 34-year-old  Maria Ohisalo  heads up the Green Party and serves as Interior Minister, 32-year-old Minister of Education  Li Andersson  is the Left Alliance chair, and 55-year-old  Anna-Maja Henriksson  is the Swedish People’s Party leader and Minister of Justice. \n Marin has risen very quickly through the political ranks since she became head of Tampere City Council at the age of 27, and she is currently into her second term as a member of parliament. She already has some experience in the top job as she led the party during the previous incumbent  Antti Rinne 's  sick leave  last winter. \n Marin set out the vision for her premiership in a  letter  to SDP members on Sunday, as she wrote \"Finland is in the midst of an exceptional situation. The main focus for Social Democrats is to continue our work in building a fairer and more egalitarian society.\""}
{"text": "The reshuffle of Finland's government continues on Monday. The previous evening, the two main partners, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Centre Party, decided to form a slightly altered cabinet based on the same platform as its predecessor. \n To the surprise of some within its own leadership, the Centre announced a key ministerial swap on Monday morning. \n Katri Kulmuni , who took over as Centre leader in September, is to become finance minister while outgoing finance chief  Mika Lintilä  will in effect be demoted to his former post as minister of economic affairs. The finance minister, who oversees the budget, also traditionally serves as deputy prime minister. \n Kulmuni said she considers it crucial that cooperation is smooth between the government's 'power duo' of prime minister and finance minister. \n In both cases, the former older male ministers are being replaced by younger women. The five weightiest portfolios in the new cabinet will likely be held by women, four of them in their early 30s. \n In a difficult situation, Kulmuni said, it is the party leader's responsibility to take on the heaviest portfolio. After her speech, she told Yle that the changes had been made faster than she expected, and unanimously. \n \"We didn't know that the whole Council of State would change. When a big change takes place, it is important that the government's axle, the power duo of prime minister and finance minister, works. That is the foundation of this 'red soil' government,\" she said, using the old moniker for partnerships between the left-leaning SDP and the agrarian-rooted Centre. \n \"We do the jobs offered by the people's movement\" \n Lintilä, meanwhile, professed to being pleased with returning to his former post of Minister of Economic Affairs, which he held from 2016 until last summer. The title is a relatively recent addition to Finnish cabinets, having only been coined in 2008. Kulmuni was the first woman to hold the post, and only had it for half a year. \n Asked if he would have wanted to carry on as finance minister, Lintilä declined to answer directly. \n \"Here we always do the jobs offered by the people's movement. They are both excellent posts in which it is extremely interesting to work,\" he replied. \n Yle has learned that the switch came as a surprise to others in the party's leadership and ministerial group. Some 'key individuals' were first informed of the change just before the morning press conference. \n According to Kulmuni, the change \"came at the proposal of the party chair\". \n The other Centre ministers from the outgoing  Antti Rinne  government are to remain in their positions:  Antti Kaikkonen  as Defence Minister,  Jari Leppä  as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and  Hanna Kosonen  as Minister of Science and Culture. \n Kosonen took over that job when  Annika Saarikko  went on family leave in August, two months after taking office. She is expected to return to the post in August 2020. \n Smaller parties likely to keep ministers \n Of the junior government partners, at least the Swedish People's Party plans to keep its two ministers in the same posts: party chair  Anna-Maja Henriksson  as Justice Minister and  Thomas Blomqvist  as Minister for Nordic Cooperation and Equality. \n The Greens and Left Alliance are to confirm later on Monday whether they will join the revamped government. Both have leadership meetings scheduled for 4pm. \n Both are expected to carry on with their current ministers. The cabinet has officially been a caretaker government since last Tuesday when  Rinne resigned as prime minister  after Kulmuni's Centre expressed a nebulously-worded lack of confidence in him following a protracted labour dispute. \n On Sunday evening the SDP decided to replace him as prime minister with  current Minister of Transport and Communications Sanna Marin , after she narrowly defeated parliamentary group chair  Antti Lindtman  in a party council vote. \n The party has nominated Rinne to become deputy speaker of parliament, replacing  Tuula Haatainen . She is expected to return to government as employment minister, taking over from  Timo Harakka , who in turn is to succeed Marin in the transport post. \n Rinne says he plans to remain party leader until next summer. He predicted on Sunday that Parliament will vote on his replacement on Tuesday. That is expected to be a rubber-stamp approval, as the five parties hold a strong majority. \n Approval on Tuesday would allow time for Marin to be appointed by the president and sworn in before Thursday, when she is to head to Brussels for a European Council summit. It effectively marks the end of Finland's six-month presidency of the body."}
{"text": "A  new government  is to be sworn in on Tuesday, and the papers are full of analysis and speculation about how it will work. \n Helsingin Sanomat  publishes  an analysis piece suggesting that the Centre Party wants to drag the government back to the centre ground after what centre MPs felt was a leftist turn under outgoing PM  Antti Rinne . \n The former trade union boss had made several interventions in the labour market in support of pay demands for low-paid workers and his actions in the postal workers’ dispute eventually sparked his removal from office. \n Centre politicians have often expressed this objection as a difficulty with politicians poking their noses in to issues that should be settled between unions and employers. That’s not quite the whole story, according to the HS piece. \n Labour strife \n \"Interfering in the labour market was not a problem for the Centre Party during the last government,\" writes political reporter  Teemu Muhonen . \"Back then the Centre, as the party of the prime minister, forced through a weakening of employment conditions in the ‘competitiveness pact’ to improve the position of businesses.\" \n Centre leader  Katri Kulmuni  has set her stall out as demanding measures to increase employment (code for cutting unemployment benefits), and expects incoming premier  Sanna Marin  to yield to her demands. \n But as Marin’s own politics are probably to the left of Rinne’s, that could be a tricky negotiation. One thing that does unite the two traditional parties, writes Muhonen, is a desire to avoid fresh elections as they struggle in the polls. \n Kauppalehti  nails  its colours to the mast, stating that Marin’s election moves the government to the left and that this will be ‘Marin’s government but Rinne’s government programme’. \n That's also the basis on which the  five-party coalition has agreed to continue its work . \n International reach \n The business daily is satisfied, however, that the labour movement’s hotline to the Prime Minister’s office will be broken, and says that might mean a calmer labour market. \n The international press had plenty of coverage of  Marin’s elevation , with her youth and the gender of her four female counterparts leading government parties dominating those stories. \n The New York Times  covered  the story, as did  the BBC , the  Guardian ,  CNN  and even the  Daily Mail . \n The Mail found its special own angle, perhaps inevitably trawling the new PM’s Instagram account for their picture-heavy story. \n Marin’s impressive reach was confirmed by Soundi magazine, which got a  whole article  out of Rage Against the Machine singer  Tom Morello ’s Instagram post. Morello claimed Marin is a fan, and Soundi wondered whether this serendipitous coincidence might tempt Morello to bring the recently-reformed band to Finland for a concert. \n Syrian sojourn ending for some? \n In other stories, Ilta-Sanomat  reports  that plans to repatriate families from the al-Hol camp in Syria are at an advanced stage, with Helsinki social workers already informed about the identities of people expected to return. \n The issue has been the subject of some debate, with Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  criticised by some officials in the ministry. \n On Monday he was  cleared by the ministry's senior civil servant  of acting illegally in trying to bring the families home, but it remains unclear how active Finland can or will be in helping people return from Syria. \n The IS story states that social workers are ready and prepared to respond whether people make it home under their own steam or are assisted in returning from the conflict zone. \n Free daycare in Paltamo \n Finland has stressed and worried about declining birth rates and a depopulated countryside, but the municipality of Paltamo in the sparsely-populated north-east has come up with a partial solution: free daycare. \n Finnish families pay for daycare for children aged 0-5, but the cost is heavily-subsidised and income-linked. In Paltamo, though, it will be a nice round zero--down from up to 434 euros a month for a family with two children earning more than 4,799 euros per month. \n The local council made the decision on Monday, and told local  paper Kainuun Sanomat  that making it free of charge was the ‘cherry on the cake’ of high-quality provision and decent facilities."}

During her entire political career she hasn’t experienced the kind of publicity storm that took place following the postal scandal. \n \"I must admit that although I have a lot of experience, this is not the type of experience I wanted,\" she said. \"I hope that this teaches me and others to have stricter boundaries.\""}

The SDP, National Coalition, Centre Party and Swedish People’s Party were all opposed. \n One reason was that the current six-year terms offer continuity in foreign policy, for which the president is responsible. \n \"One big problem we have these days is short-termism, and shortening the president’s term in office could be a small step in the wrong direction on that front,\" said  Kai Mykkänen , who chairs the National Coalition group in parliament and even proposed lengthening parliamentary terms from the current four years to five. \n The Finns Party and Christian Democrats said they would look into the matter, the Greens did not express a preference, and the Left Alliance did not answer the question. \n \"In my opinion, it is at least worth discussing,\" said Finns Party caucus leader  Ville Tavio . \"I intend to find out what citizens think about the issue.\" \n Niinistö has repeatedly suggested shortening presidential terms, with different options including five-year terms with a two-term limit and four-year terms with a three-term limit."}
{"text": "Finland has a new government, headed by Social Democratic Party vice chair,  Sanna Marin . The administration is Finland’s 76th. \n At just 34 years old, Marin, the former Minister for Transport and Communications, is now  the world’s youngest premier . Her cabinet consists of 12 women and seven men. All leaders of the five-party government coalition are women. \n President  Sauli Niinistö  appointed the new administration shortly after 3pm on Tuesday, at the same time accepting the resignation of the previous government led by SDP chair  Antti Rinne . \n Rinne had been premier for just six months before  tendering his resignation  over his mishandling of a labour dispute between postal workers and their state-owned employer, national mail carrier Posti. Rinne and his government continued in a caretaker capacity until Marin's formal appointment on Tuesday. \n \"A historic day\" \n There was plenty of praise for the new government, with observers commending its youth and composition – including the opposition. \n \"A historic day: the world gets the youngest sitting prime minister and Finland gets a government in which all of the party leaders are women. It is amazing that this is possible, specifically in Finland,\" chair of the opposition National Coalition Party  Petteri Orpo  tweeted. \n Prior to Niinistö’s appointment of the new government, MPs voted on Tuesday afternoon to confirm Marin as the new head of government. Government MPs gave Marin a comfortable margin of 99 votes to 70 to seal the deal. Thirty MPs were not present for the vote. \n On Wednesday, MPs will elect a new Deputy Speaker to replace  Tuula Haatainen , who will take on the weighty portfolio of Labour Minister in Marin’s cabinet following a government shakeup.

{"text": "A dispute over the possible repatriation of Finnish women and children from the Al-Hol refugee camp in Syria back to Finland has led to a split within the Finnish foreign ministry, and engulfed foreign minister  Pekka Haavisto  in a political crisis. \n The saga centres on a dispute between Haavisto and  Pasi Tuominen , the Director General of Consular Services at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The issue turns on whether ot not Haavisto reassigned certain tasks and responsibilities regarding the Al-Hol camp to another ministry official, effectively sidelining Tuominen. \n When tabloid daily Ilta-Sanomat broke the story on 2 December, staff told the newspaper that there was an \"atmosphere of fear\" at the ministry. \n Yle has assembled a timeline of events to clarify the claims and counter-claims in the war of words. \n 27 June, 2019 \n The government of freshly-elected Prime Minister  Antti Rinne  announces that it will  not actively seek to repatriate Finnish citizens from the Al-Hol refugee camp in Syria . \n In response to a question by the opposition Finns Party and National Coalition Party during parliamentary question time, the prime minister said that his administration had \"no plans to use consular services to bring these people to Finland\". \n Foreign minister Haavisto, however, emphasised that Finnish citizens would be provided with assistance should they seek it themselves. \n \"If such people turn to the Consulate of Finland somewhere, as Finns they will, of course, be allowed to return,\" Haavisto said. \n At around the same time, Pasi Tuominen’s contract in his role as Director General of Consular Services at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is extended until 2022. \n Story continues after photo. \n Director General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Pasi Tuominen. Aku Häyrynen / Lehtikuva \n September \n Haavisto meets with Rinne to discuss the situation at Al-Hol, and according to Haavisto they agree on a way forward. \n \"We discussed that it would be good to send a delegation to the region to get better information on the situation, as other Nordic countries had also established contact with the Kurdish administration,\" Haavisto recalls of the meeting in a later interview with Helsingin Sanomat. \n Haavisto then reportedly meets with officials from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who tell the minister that Finland is not prepared to start similar research work to help citizens as has been carried out by other Nordic countries. According to another report by Ilta-Sanomat, Haavisto flies into a \"rage\" over this response. Haavisto denies this. \n \"As the minister I was in a very difficult position, because the Ministry and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are responsible for the safety of Finnish citizens in danger, but my ministry had no solution,\" Haavisto later explained to Helsingin Sanomat. \n Story continues after photo. \n A woman carrying a child at the Al-Hol refugee camp on December 9, 2019. Delil Souleiman / AFP \n Haavisto is apparently now convinced that Tuominen \"would allow the children to die in the camp,\" an accusation which Tuominen subsequently denies to Helsingin Sanomat. \n 10 October \n Chancellor of Justice  Tuomas Pöysti  receives a complaint that the government, the prime minister, the minister of the interior and the minister of foreign affairs are failing to take steps to help Finnish citizens in danger. The complaint is based on the international obligations and laws to which Finland is bound, specifically relating to the rights of children. \n Story continues after photo. \n Tuomas Pöysti. Tiina Jutila / Yle \n Although Pöysti believes that it would be legally easier to bring both children and their guardians to Finland and then place them in care, he does consider it possible that children could be repatriated without the consent of the guardian. \n He further emphasises that the authorities' options to operate within the Al-Hol refugee camp are limited and that they have to adapt in practice to the conditions of the camp administrators. By this, Pöysti implies that the Kurdish government in the area does not want the children of the camp to be separated from their mothers. \n Pöysti’s interpretation of the Al-Hol situation does not necessarily oblige the authorities to act in a certain way and leaves them a certain amount of discretion. \n 18 October \n Internal pressure begins to build within the ministry of foreign affairs, as Haavisto interprets Pöysti’s announcement as obliging the ministry to act in the best interests of the children. He gives instructions to Tuominen, which the director general finds illegal and coercive. \n Tuominen writes to Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary of State  Pekka Puustinen  that he is afraid of being sentenced to prison if he begins the process of repatriating children to Finland without any political decision. This  email  will be later published by Ilta-Sanomat on December 4. \n Story continues after photo. \n Pekka Puustinen. Yle \n According to another email seen by Ilta-Sanomat and sent on the same day as Tuominen writes to Puustinen, Haavisto's Special Assistant  Joel Linnainmäki  delivers the foreign minister's instruction that consular services should place an official in the city of Erbil, Iraq on a one-month mission. \n \"This person is preparing for a situation where Finnish citizens will be crossing the border from Syria,\" Linnainmäki writes, adding that \"the point is that at least the children from the Al-Hol camp will be made safe within a reasonable time if security risks in the area increase.\" \n Pasi Tuominen refuses to obey this instruction because he and the consular department believe the government should make a decision on such a big issue. \n 23 October \n Haavisto reassigns Pasi Tuominen away from Al-Hol consular duties, and appointed an interim Al-Hol Special Representative. \n His role is to liaise and negotiate with the Kurdish authorities on the possible repatriation of Finnish citizens, and HS reports that the representative is given the authority to decide on the evacuation of both children and their guardians to Finland on a case-by-case basis. \n In practice, evacuations should not take place unless the Prime Minister, the President and the Foreign Affairs Committee were all informed. \n The appointment is a confidential matter due to security reasons, and is known by only a very small circle. \n Tuominen considers the decision to reassign his responsibilities for the Al-Hol camp to be in breach of the law, but Haavisto and the department’s senior management argue they have extensive powers to change the internal division of labour, if deemed necessary. \n 31 October \n The government is informed of the Al-Hol Special Representative's appointment at an evening meeting. Both the representative and the Chancellor of Justice Tuomas Pöysti are present. According to Haavisto, no minister or party objects to the appointment or the assignment. \n Helsingin Sanomat reports that Pöysti's stance is that as long as the representative cooperates with other Finnish authorities, especially child welfare, the operation is legally sustainable. \n Haavisto and the representative agree they will inform President  Sauli Niinistö  of the ministry for foreign affairs's actions. \n The government has still not taken a formal position on the repatriation of Finnish citizens, but at some point in the autumn the foreign ministry will send two officials to Erbil. \n Mid-November \n Undersecretary Puustinen informs Pasi Tuominen that Haavisto wants to transfer him to a different position by the end of 2019. The decision was apparently made a couple of weeks earlier, but Tuominen was not immediately informed. \n In addition to the dispute over Al-Hol, Tuominen and Haavisto had also clashed over Russian visa requirements. \n On 19 November, Ilta-Sanomat reports that a successor is being sought for Tuominen. \n 29 November \n At a meeting of ministry staff, Puustinen tells Tuominen's \"shocked subordinates\" of the plan to move Tuominen to a different role. \n \"For the time being, consular chief Tuominen will act as Head of Consular Affairs, with the exception of one unit which has been transferred to another official. This issue is also very sensitive at the political level,\" Puustinen said at the meeting according to minutes leaked to Ilta-Sanomat. \n IS later reports, on 4 December, that Haavisto has already personally selected a successor for Tuominen. \n 2 December \n Ilta-Sanomat publishes a  story  about the so-called 'Operation Korpi', which the tabloid alleges involves the foreign minister’s plan to repatriate children from the Al-Hol camp back to Finland. \n The article further alleges that Haavisto punished Tuominen because he refused to comply with the order to repatriate only children from the camp, as Tuominen deemed it illegal. \n Haavisto denies that he put any pressure on anyone and justifies the transfer of Tuominen as being a normal rotation of official duties. Haavisto says he is unfamiliar with any 'Operation Korpi'. \n Katja-Marika Puittinen , Owner of Immigration Processes at the ministry of foreign affairs, tells Yle in response to the Ilta-Sanomat story that there is an atmosphere of fear within the department. \n Later in the day, President Sauli Niinistö tells the Verkkouutiset online news service that he was unaware of any decision regarding Al-Hol, thereby giving the impression that certain information was not passed onto the president by the foreign minister. \n In the evening, Haavisto holds a press conference where he says the ministry must prepare for different outcomes, such as, for example, if the al-Hol camp is disbanded chaotically. Haavisto says that cooperation between the authorities in this matter is called Operation Korpi. \n Haavisto adds that every potential repatriation is considered on a case-by-case basis, and that President Niinistö is aware of the plans. He denies ever having ordered children to be repatriated without their parents. \n Haavisto states that Pasi Tuominen is still in charge of the consular post and that the position has not been opened for a successor. The only change of personnel in the ministry, according to Haavisto, is the appointment of a separate person to handle al-Hol issues. \n This statement by Haavisto causes many ministry officials to lose confidence in the minister because they say the he is lying about Tuominen continuing in his job. \n \"After the press conference, there was a sense of solidarity with Tuominen in the corridors of the ministry,\" one official commented to Yle. \n 3 December \n Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee speaks with Haavisto and Pöysti. The committee is content with Haavisto's version of events, except for the Finns Party, who claim Haavisto has kept parliament in the dark on this issue. \n Haavisto explains that the information has to be kept confidential so as not to jeopardise the assigned official, the Finnish citizens at the camp or the success of the whole operation. \n \"The members of the Ministerial Council have been aware but have not had to make decisions, since all the actions have been preparatory actions that have clarified the situation of the Finnish citizens at the camp and the attitude of various authorities in the area to help these people,\" Haavisto said. \n Chancellor of Justice Tuomas Pöysti was prohibited from commenting on Haavisto's actions because he has been the subject of a number of complaints, including one criminal complaint. \n President Niinistö tells Helsingin Sanomat that he had been aware of the official appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \"other official duties\". Niinistö added that he has discussed the situation in Al-Hol with Haavisto on several occasions. \n 4 December \n Ilta-Sanomat publishes leaked documents from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs: internal emails and an excerpt of the meeting minutes from 29 November. \n Kirsi Varhila , Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, tells Yle that a search operation of the Al-Hol camp had been prepared, but that it was to include adults as well as children. \n Story continues after photo. \n Kirsi Varhila. Toni Määttä / Yle \n Haavisto appears on Yle TV1’s A-studio programme and says he had spoken with Pasi Tuominen earlier that day; and apologised to the official. Haavisto blames the problems on the flow of information within the ministry, and he says he has heard from Tuominen that there is no contradiction in the consular department about the appointed al-Hol official. \n Haavisto announces that Tuominen is welcome to continue as Consular Chief if he wishes. However, he refuses to be drawn on whether he had ousted Tuominen. \n Haavisto said the ministry was discussing the possibility of helping children in the summer, but the idea soon came to an end because of the views of the Syrian authorities. \n 5 December \n In an open letter, the trade union representing ministry staff demands an explanation from Haavisto about his \"undermining\" of the position of consular chief. \n \"This is an urgent cry for help from the staff,\" says chair  Juha Parikka , who adds that foreign ministry staff do not understand how Haavisto can change procedural rules and transfer the duties of Tuominen to another official. \n Haavisto responds to the open letter later the same day. He apologises for the internal problems and the lack of open communication about staff issues. Haavisto also references the busy autumn schedule and the challenges posed by the discovery of Finnish children in Syria as contributary factors. \n The Finns Party threaten the government with a parliamentary interpellation if Haavisto continues as foreign minister. \n \"There are three questions that are still open: whether Isis families are being brought to Finland, whether Haavisto has lied about the issue, and whether he has been pressuring an official to perform unlawful actions to bring Isis families to Finland,\" says Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho . \n Story continues after photo. \n Finns Party chair Jussi Halla-aho. Lehtikuva \n 6 December \n Pasi Tuominen goes public. In an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, he accuses Haavisto of fear-driven leadership and making illegal decisions. \n \"It is totally unacceptable that officials can only tell the minister things that Haavisto feels are promoting his own political views,\" Tuominen says. \n Haavisto denies Tuominen's claims and explains the problems of his ministry have been exacerbated by Finland’s EU Presidency. \n \"I've made the mistake that I have had too little time with the staff,\" Haavisto says. \n He reiterates that decisions on possible assistance to the Finnish citizens at Al-Hol were made with the utmost confidentiality for security reasons. \n \"I am well aware that this may have led to the appearance of secrecy,\" Haavisto says. \n Haavisto denies he chose a successor for Tuominen, but admits that different names have been mentioned. \n \"On 20 November, the Under-Secretary of State was informed that Tuominen would prefer to end his current duties as soon as possible,\" Haavisto says. \n 8 December \n Staff representative  Juha Parikka  tells Verkkouutiset that distrust of Haavisto within the ministry remains, as he still seems to be telling a \"modified truth\". Parikka finds it particularly problematic that important policy decisions have been made unilaterally by Haavisto. \n Green Party chair  Maria Ohisalo , says that she \"of course\" has confidence in Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto. According to Ohisalo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long had unresolved problems, and not just under Haavisto’s tenure. \n Story continues after photo. \n Greens Party chair Maria Ohisalo. Lehtikuva \n 9 December \n Yle reports that the government had a more detailed plan than previously known for relocating Al-Hol women and children to Finland. The plan is to prevent Finnish citizens from dying in the camp when, for example, the weather gets cold. According to Yle sources, the ouline documents are classified as confidential. \n Chancellor of Justice Tuomas Pöysti says he will launch an investigation into the activities of the Foreign Minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs related to the Al-Hol issue. \n Pekka Puustinen, Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sends an internal bulletin to staff at the ministry, in which he declares his support for Haavisto. According to Puustinen, the al-Hol debate is the result of a serious divergence of views within the ministry, and that not everyone shares the view of the ministry's \"atmosphere of fear\". \n Consulate Chief Pasi Tuominen does not comment on the latest developments, nor does he confirm if he intends to continue in his job."}
{"text": "Finland’s freshly-appointed Prime Minister  Sanna Marin  opened her time in office by declaring that she will maintain her social media habits as a representative of the younger generation. Speaking during her new administration’s first press conference  after being sworn into office on Tuesday afternoon , Marin told media representatives that she \"is still a real person\". \n \"When it comes to social media or Instagram, I think I’m an individual -- a real person even though I’m a prime minister also. So I won’t change the way I behave,\" Marin said in response to a question about her use of social media before becoming premier. The question was a reference to  a Daily Mail article  that dubbed her \"a politician for the Instagram generation\". \n You can listen to our weekly All Points North podcast via this embedded player,  Yle Areena ,  Spotify ,  iTunes  or your normal pod player using the  RSS feed . \n However she tempered her declaration with an acknowledgement that in future, she will also represent the government she leads. \n \"Of course I have to be careful about what I say because it can be represented as the whole government. But I’m still a person and I will be in the future also,\" she added. \n Andersson: \"We're just human\" \n Marin’s comments were backed up by her colleague, Left Alliance chair and Education Minister  Li Andersson , who said that it would be good for people to get to know politicians. \n \"What kind of music we like, what we do during our very sparse free time, how we hang out together behind the scenes, while negotiating. Because I think that’s something that I’ve missed from public debate and politics for a long time. We’re just human all of us,\" Andersson declared. \n Sticking to business, Interior Minister and Greens chair  Maria Ohisalo  said that the government’s first steps next year will involve implementing the budget agreed on under the stewardship of ex-PM  Antti Rinne . \n \"Next year the first steps about the budget that the previous government has already decided on steps into reality and people will see in their everyday lives how this government programme already affects their lives. So we are here for the whole of Finnish society,\" the minister commented. \n Off to Brussels this week \n Marin told journalists at the press conference that her administration will begin its work today to build a society that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. \n \"We want to make Finland a country where any child can become anything and everyone can live and grow old safely and happily. We’re going to be active in the European Union and globally. We want to create stability,\" she added. \n The PM said that she will meet her EU colleagues at a European Council meeting in Brussels on 12-13 December. \n Marin took over from SDP chair Antti Rinne following a confidence crisis that saw Rinne tender his resignation.

{"text": "Helsinki daily  Helsingin Sanomat  reports that the dispute over the possible repatriation of Finnish women and children from the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria took a new turn on Tuesday evening when President  Sauli Niinistö  called for a \"clear political decision on the matter\". \n In a comment forwarded to the paper by the president's office, Niinistö pointed to what he called an increasing flurry of speculation surrounding the issue and stated, \"It would be good for the new government to have a moment of calm and consider making a clear political decision.\" \n The possible repatriation of Finnish women and children being held in the al-Hol camp in Syria  has become a major issue and the first serious challenge  facing the new government headed by  Sanna Marin , says Helsingin Sanomat. \n The paper points out that this is a politically sensitive issue because bringing the children to safety would also mean repatriating their mothers. The mothers, writes HS, have close connections to Isis. \n Parties in the coalition government have been avoiding a political decision on repatriation, instead relegating it to information talks at working meetings of the cabinet. \n The opposition Finns party is planning to force a vote of no-confidence in the government over the issue. Helsingin Sanomat notes a STT news agency report that the National Coalition Party is considering joining in the push for a vote of no-confidence. \n Turku's  Turun Sanomat  reports that the Christian Democratic Party decided late Tuesday evening to back the move. In its announcement, the CDP said that repatriation plans have been advanced without a clear political decision and without informing parliament. It added that Prime Minister Sanna Marin \"has not been able to answer questions about the foreign minister's actions and conflicting statements\". \n New rules for politicians \n Oulu's Kaleva notes that  one of the first measures  of the new Marin government after taking office was to shield cabinet ministers from corporate headhunters. \n According to a decision taken on Tuesday, any minister leaving a government post will face a six-month ban on taking on any new job that could be seen as a conflict of interest. \n Legislation is in the works that will prevent sitting ministers from resigning to go straight to jobs related to their work in government. Until such time as that becomes law, Marin is relying on the personal pledges of cabinet members. \n A Council of Europe body, the Group of States against Corruption, has cautioned Finland against the practice of leading civil servants and cabinet ministers moving back and forth between public service and the private sector. \n Advice from oldest to youngest \n Sanna Marin's entry into the premiership at the age of 34, making her the  world's youngest head of government , has attracted worldwide attention. \n Finland's leading Swedish-language daily,  Hufvudstadsbladet  reports that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who at the age of 94 is the world's oldest head of government, Tuesday commented on Sanna Marin's rise by passing along a piece of advice to his younger colleague. \n In an interview with Reuters,  Mahathir Mohamad  stated, “While we believe in the idealism of young people, it is important also for them to consider the experience of the old people”. \n “Then there will be a combination of the two, and that would be good,” he added. \n Striking at full pay \n Strikes and solidarity strikes in the industrial sector this week have seen  nearly 100,000 workers  lay down their tools and walk off the job, trading lost pay for the chance pressure employers for better contract conditions. \n There is once sector, however, where workers are on strike, but getting full pay anyway. \n According to the economic and business daily  Kauppalehti , some companies in the chemicals sector are paying striking employees to come to work even though they are not producing anything. \n The paper points out that it is not only difficult, but also potentially dangerous to completely shut down some chemical industry processes. \n Kauppalehti take as an example the Borealis Polymers plant in Porvoo where around 75 percent of some 900 officially striking workers have been coming in to supervise plant safety while production is suspended. \n Company management told the paper that it is seeing significant losses because of the strike. The labour action has not only stopped production for the three day strike period. This was preceded by two days it took to wind down processes, and it may take another five days to get back up to speed once the strike ends. \n Environmental visions 50 years ago \n Kuopio's  Savon Sanomat  on Wednesday turned the clock back just about half a century with a look at an editorial published by its sister paper, Iisalmen Sanomat, on 14 December 1969. \n The Council of Europe had just declared the new year, 1970, as European Conservation year. Even though Finland was not yet a member of the body, it joined in the effort to protect the natural environment. \n Savon Sanomat writes that at that time, this was the greatest international wake-up call to the need to protect the planet and its natural resources. \n What was envisaged was the creation of a strategy to protect the natural environment and a search to find the means to implement that strategy. \n 50 years ago, Iisalmen Sanomat wrote that awareness of the dangers was important, but that merely an interest in environmental questions would not be enough. The paper stressed that what was really essential was a long-term plan that would take into account the needs of future generations."}
{"text": "The five-party government coalition led by the Social Democratic Party has been in office for just six months, but already there has been a shake-up of ministerial portfolios, following a loss of confidence in the leadership of SDP chair and ex-premier  Antti Rinne . \n The biggest changes have occurred among the ranks of the senior government partner, the SDP, with just a few ministers continuing in their original positions. \n You can listen to our weekly All Points North podcast via this embedded player, Yle Areena, Spotify, iTunes or your normal pod player using the RSS feed. \n Sanna Marin, Prime Minister, SDP \n At 34,  Sanna Marin  has become the youngest premier in the world following Antti Rinne’s resignation from the post following a political firestorm. In a vote by the party leadership last Sunday, Marin won a razor-thin victory over the other frontrunner, SDP parliamentary chair  Antti Lindtman . She is a popular politician favoured by voters and is now expected to help boost the party’s voter approval rating from its current low point. \n Marin was the former Transport and Communications Minister in the Rinne administration. She had already begun to grab headlines at the beginning of the year when she took over from the ailing party chair who went on sick leave in the prelude to the general election. Marin had already earned accolades over her steady stewardship of a contentious Tampere city council, with videos of the meetings taking social media by storm. \n Tytti Tuppurainen, Minister for European Affairs and Ownership Steering, SDP \n Social Democratic MP  Tytti Tuppurainen  will continue as Minister for European Affairs, but will also assume responsibility for the troublesome state ownership and steering portfolio. Like her fellow MP  Timo Harakka , Tuppurainen had also challenged Antti Rinne for the chairmanship of the party some years ago. Gender equality issues are close to her heart and she is the chair of the SDP women’s group. \n Sirpa Paatero, Minister of Local Government, SDP \n Media coverage of the recent government crisis painted former State Ownership Steering Minister  Sirpa Paatero  as a scapegoat in the affair. She resigned, presumably for not prosecuting the government’s desire to protect 700 postal workers who were transferred to lower-paying employment contracts by their employer, the state-owned mail carrier Posti. After stepping down, Paatero went on sick leave only to return this week as Municipal Affairs Minister in the reformulated administration. Paatero is widely considered to be a confidant of ex-prime minister Antti Rinne. \n Timo Harakka, Transport and Communications Minister, SDP \n Timo Harakka  previously held responsibility for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in the Rinne administration but in the new government he takes over from Sanna Marin as Transport and Communications Minister. Harakka should be comfortable with the new brief, given that before his career in politics he was an Yle journalist known as the host of the “Black Box” discussion programme from 1997 to 2000. He was also a presenter and producer of the light entertainment current affairs television show “Pressiklubi”. During the six months in his previous position, he entombed the much-reviled “activation model”, which required unemployed jobseekers to meet certain criteria to maintain their benefits. The SDP saw its favourability soar when it protested the model in opposition. \n Tuula Haatainen, Economic Affairs and Employment Minister, SDP \n Veteran SDP politico  Tuula Haatainen  takes over from Harakka as Economic Affairs and Employment Minister and now faces one of the government’s most testing challenges of boosting employment. She will leave behind the position of Deputy Speaker to take up her new portfolio and will in turn offer the important post to outgoing PM Rinne. Last year, Haatainen challenged  Sauli Niinistö ’s hold on the presidency when she contested the presidential election as an SDP candidate and placed third. She is one of the more experienced ministers in the cabinet, having previously served as Education as well as Social Affairs and Health Minister. She was also a deputy mayor of Helsinki and deputy chair of the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities before she returned to parliament as an MP in 2015. \n Krista Kiuru, Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services, SDP \n Family Affairs and Social Services Minister is one of just two ministers to retain her original portfolio following the recent government upheaval. An experienced minister  Krista Kiur u came under scrutiny during the final stages of the last government as a colourful figure in negotiations over then-Prime Minister  Juha Sipilä ’s ambitious bid to overhaul social and health care services. At the time she was chair of Parliament’s Social Affairs and Health Committee. The Pori resident is a four-term MP, who has previously served as a minister of housing and communications, education and education and communications. \n Ville Skinnari, Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, SDP \n Lahti resident  Ville Skinnari  is another minister who will retain his old brief in the new administration. He is one of the SDP’s economic policy wonks and is often positioned on the right of the left-leaning party. Like Marin, he is one of the party vice chairs. The second-term MP is a former national ice hockey player and is the son of ex-parliamentarian  Jouko Skinnari . \n Katri Kulmuni, Finance Minister, Centre Party \n Centre Party chair  Katri Kulmuni  nabbed the Finance Ministry portfolio from predecessor  Mikä Lintilä  during the cabinet reshuffle. The swap offers Kulmuni an opportunity to dig the party out of a voter approval slump, particularly after she was criticized for what some saw as a spiritless performance when she declared that the Centre had no confidence in ex-PM Rinne. The Tornio resident proved to be a vote magnet during last spring’s parliamentary elections. \n Mika Lintilä, Minister for Economic Affairs, Centre Party \n After six months as Finance Minister, Mika Lintilä has deferred to his party leader Katri Kulmuni and taken up a new position as Economic Affairs Minister. The post is not new to this veteran politician, as he held the brief during the Juha Sipilä centre-right administration. He became Economic Affairs Minister when  Olli Rehn  moved over to the Bank of Finland in December 2016. Lintilä is also no stranger to parliamentary politics, having served as a lawmaker for two decades. \n Antti Kaikkonen, Minister of Defence, Centre Party \n Antti Kaikkonen  also continues in his previous role as Defence Minister. He is an influential figure in the Centre Party, having lost to Kulmuni during leadership elections. This is the five-term MP’s first stint as a minister. During the party’s time in the previous administration, he served as chair of the parliamentary group. His political career has been overshadowed by his role in a campaign funding scandal and a five-month suspended prison sentence handed down in 2013 as a result. \n Hanna Kosonen, Minister of Science and Culture, Centre Party \n Hanna Kosonen  replaces  Annika Saarikko  as Science and Culture Minister during the latter’s maternity leave. Kosonen was the deputy leader of the Centre’s parliamentary group during the last government’s term.

{"text": "Finland is opening up a wildly popular Elements of Artificial Intelligence online course to all EU citizens. The announcement was made in Brussels on Tuesday to mark the approaching end of Finland’s presidency of the Council of the EU. \n Finland assumed the rotating six-month presidency in July this year, shortly after the  Antti Rinne  administration assumed office. Rinne  has since stepped down  as Prime Minister and now heads a caretaker administration until a new cabinet is sworn in on Tuesday. \n The government said that the goal of the project is attract one percent of EU citizens – five million people – to complete the course in 2020 and 2021. The offer of the online programme marks a departure from more traditional gifts such as ties or scarves. Anyone can  sign up for the online course . \n The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment said on Tuesday that it will finance the project, which was valued at 1.7 million euros. \n Ministry permanent secretary  Pilvi Torsti  said that the AI course has become a tradition that Finland wants to continue. She said that it also answers in part the difficult question of how to develop people’s skills for the jobs of the future. \n The free online course was developed by the Reaktor consultancy and the University of Helsinki and has  been by far the most popular programme  offered by the University of Helsinki. The original goal was to get one percent of Finns or 55,000 people to study the elements of artificial intelligence, a  target that was reached  in just a few months."}
{"text": "Finland's new five-party coalition government, headed by SDP Prime Minister  Sanna Marin , hit its first serious bump on Wednesday when opposition parties in parliament filed a motion leading to a vote of no-confidence over  the repatriation of Finnish citizens currently in the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria . \n The motion, initiated by the Finns Party, gained the backing of the Christian Democrats late Tuesday and of the National Coalition Party (NCP) on Wednesday morning. It is also being supported by the sole MP of the Movement Now (Liike nyt) group. \n At a press conference Wednesday morning, opposition Finns Party chair  Jussi Halla-aho  questioned whether Finland has an obligation to aid the women and children of Isis fighters. He did concede, however, that Finnish citizens always have the right to return to the country. \n \"This is a question of the adult women. They are a concrete security risk to Finland. Once back in Finland they could continue their terrorist activities,\" Halla-aho stated. \n Halla-aho added that he wants to know if Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  has supplied accurate information on the issue. \n \"Recently we've seen a disconcerting cat and mouse game. In terms of parliamentary oversight, the situation has been unbearable,\" said Halla-aho. \"Are Isis families being brought to Finland? Have parliament and the media been misled?\" \n Backing from NCP \n The second main opposition party, the NCP decided Wednesday to back a vote of no-confidence in the government. Its parliamentary group leader, MP  Kai Mykkänen  challenged the new prime minister, Sanna Marin, to shoulder responsibility. \n \"You cannot avoid responsibility. Hopefully the government understands now that this is a serious matter,\" said Mykkänen. \n \"There is now great uncertainty whether or not the government has made a political decision and issued a mandate to repatriate Finnish citizens who took part in the operations of the Isis caliphate,\" Kai Mykkänen stated in parliament. \n The leader of the Christian Democratic Party's parliamentary group,  Päivi Räsänen , echoed a Finnish Security Intelligence Service evaluation that the women in the al-Hol camp would be a security risk. Räsänen did say she would be ready to help the children, though. \n \"However, a clear political decision must be made, without hiding behind the backs of civil servants,\" Räsänen continued. \n The NCP's Mykkänen was also in favour of aiding the children, if a way can be found to do so without compromising security. \n According to Mykkänen the government's statements on the issue have been evasive and those by Foreign Minister Haavisto have been contradictory. \n The NCP's position is that a political decision by the government is required if Finnish citizens in the al-Hol camp are to be actively assisted in returning to the country. \n \"If this does not conform to the normal operations based on the law on consular services, but rather on exceptional action, then of course the government must make a political decision. It is extremely corny that apparently an effort has been made to pressure a foreign ministry official to act illegally, without the government's mandate,\" said Mykkänen."}

{"text": "The Foreign Ministry took the lead in planning an operation to repatriate  Finnish nationals who wanted to return to Finland  from the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria, according to official documents seen by Yle. \n The material indicated that the draft plan was to have been executed this week and involved chartering a flight to bring Finnish citizens to the Helsinki-Vantaa airport via Erbil in Iraq. \n The target schedule for the repatriation flight was week 50 of this year – this week. \n Minister denies detailed preps \n Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  has been  caught up in a maelstrom over allegations  that he wanted to push through a plan to bring the women and children back to Finland, even going so far as to sideline a top ministry official in the process. \n At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, he rejected assertions that detailed plans existed to bring Finnish citizens home. \n He added that the ministry must constantly have a number of different options ready for possible implementation. \n He also avoided comment on whether or not government should adopt a formal position on the repatriation of Finns with ties to individuals who had fought among the ranks of Isis extremists. \n \"The Foreign Ministry’s policy is that at least the children should be brought to safety,\" he told journalists. \n Safeguarding children’s rights \n However the document that Yle saw contained a detailed draft dated 21 November. It stated that the Foreign Ministry had a working group plan dated 15 November, that would guarantee the personal safety and fundamental rights of the children according to the constitution, international agreements and other legislation. \n The draft plan called for the return to Finland from al-Hol of \"all individuals who agreed to repatriation\". The documents describe the details of the plan and the proposed role of police at different stages of the operation. \n Yle learned that ministry officials were prepared to make changes to the draft arrangements. The main goal was \"to get all persons at the Al-Hol camp who were willing to return [to Finland] to Erbil in Kurd-controlled Iraq in one in attempt, from where they would be brought by charter flight to the Helsinki-Vantaa airport in Finland\". \n The document outlined one back-up plan that involved several charter flights and the possible use of other airports in Finland apart from Helsinki-Vantaa. \n Police on board \n It went on to state that the schedule for executing the operation was entirely dependent on conditions laid down by local players in the area and the security guarantees they could provide. \n The Foreign Ministry would take the lead on the operation, which would end once the returnees were on Finnish soil, the document stated. \n Police operations regarding the repatriated persons would be planned and executed separately, according to the official account. \n The chair of the operation, which was drafted in November, is a ministry employee. The working group included representatives of the Foreign Ministry, Interior Ministry, the Social Affairs and Health Ministry and the Defence Ministry. \n The operation was dubbed KORPI by the working group, and the document stressed its extreme sensitivity \"from security perspectives and an international dimension\". The document was signed by police commissioner  Seppo Kolehmainen . \n Kolehmainen has previously denied seeing any plan outlining preparations to bring Finnish citizens in the Syrian camp back to Finland. \n Minister: \"Communication could have been better\" \n Meanwhile Haavisto admitted during Wednesday’s press conference that there was room for improvement in communication on the matter. However he said that the situation had been complicated by the children’s right to legal protections. \n \"If for example, information emerged that only the children were being removed from the camp, people at the camp might start hiding them,\" he said by way of explanation. \n The minister noted that different scenarios had been drawn up since last summer in the event that the camp was shuttered. However he preferred not to comment in detail on those options. \n He said that the children’s mothers had done wrong by travelling to a conflict region. However the children needed help and he compared their circumstances to child kidnapping. \n PM: Implicit approval from government \n Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister  Sanna Marin  commented on the situation in Parliament. \n \"I have no information about any official operation, dates or persons,\" she declared. \n She had previously noted that the matter of the repatriations had been discussed at informal government sessions and that Haavisto’s policy had the government’s implicit approval. \n At the same time, opposition parties  tabled a confidence vote on alleged repatriation plans  with a view to getting explicit an explicit account from the minister about his actions. \n The government will respond to the interpellation next Tuesday before facing its first confidence vote on Wednesday. \n Centre's Kulmuni: \"No political decisions\" yet \n Meanwhile Centre Party chair and Finance Minister  Katri Kulmuni  said it’s now time to consider whether or not Finland’s legislation is up to dealing with the situation. \n \"No political decisions have been made. Just like you I am reliant on media information. However the Centre Party’s line is that terrorists should not be helped or supported,\" Kulmuni commented. \n In a Helsingin Sanomat piece, President  Sauli Niinistö  called on the new government to make a clear political decision on whether or not to repatriate Finnish citizens from the al-Hol refugee camp. \n \"Various assumptions have been put forward at an accelerating rate in recent days. The new government would do well to take a moment and consider making clear political decisions,\" Niinistö a message to HS. \n Last summer the  Antti Rinne -led government said that  it would not actively seek to return Finnish nationals  from the refugee camp in Syria. At the time Rinne said that his administration was not considering evacuations via channels such as consular services."}
{"text": "Both Yle and Helsingin Sanomat have reported on  documents showing the existence of a draft plan  to repatriate Finnish nationals who wanted to return to Finland from the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria. \n The tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  writes that a decision on such a plan is needed, but that no one wants to take responsibility. Leading government ministers have avoided questions about making a political decision, and the issue became further clouded on Wednesday. \n This is the case now, notes Ilta-Sanomat, even though President  Sauli Niinistö  stated on Tuesday evening that the government should make a decision. \n During the day Wednesday, Centre Party leader and finance minister  Katri Kulmuni  told this paper that she backed the president's call. Later during an interview with Yle, she denied any knowledge of a plan and stated that it is her party's position that the adult Finnish nationals in the al-Hol refugee camps should not be repatriated. \n Kulmuni added that responsibility lies with Green League Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto . \n Social Democratic Prime Minister  Sanna Marin  stated Wednesday that the issue of the repatriations had been discussed at informal government sessions and that Haavisto’s policy had the government’s \"tacit approval\". \n But she as well denied any knowledge of an operational plan, dates or personnel who could be involved. \n Also in an Yle interview, Interior Minister  Maria Ohisalo , who chairs the Green League, stated that she could not comment on confidential matters that involve the safety of individuals. \n Ilta-Sanomat writes that a 15-minute press conference by Foreign Minister Haavisto did not address many questions and did not clarify who is carrying responsibility in the affair and denied knowledge of a repatriation plan. \n \"If it were possible to carry out a concrete operation, I'd be the first to know. At present, there is no such thing,\" Pekka Haavisto told the media. \n Disinformation frenzy \n Helsinki’s  Iltalehti reports  that a long-planned crisis exercise organized by Finnish Customs and eight other public agencies at Helsinki Airport on Tuesday and Wednesday aroused a deluge of misinformation and disinformation on social media. \n The exercise brought various response units together to practice dealing with a toxic biological threat at the nation's main airport. \n Speculation, and then a flood of social media messages tagged the exercise as a cover-up for the arrival of a flight carrying Finnish nationals from the al-Hol refugee camp. \n The director of communications at Finnish Customs,  Mika Parkkonen , told the paper that there were thousands of postings claiming the exercise was a diversion. \n \"As a whole, this can certainly be called disinformation,\" said Parkkonen, who has been in his post since 2014. \"Indeed, this is the largest campaign of disinformation Finnish Customs has been subjected to since I've been in the job. In fact, it's the first major case of disinformation.\" \n \"Finnish Customs is not directly involved in immigration or repatriation, but the discussion on social media linked Customs to those in what we think is an odd way,\" Parkkonen added \n From strikes to lockouts \n A three-day strike by around 100,000 employees in the industrial sector wrapped up on Wednesday, but now about 4,300 workers in the mechanical wood processing industry find themselves locked out, reports  Helsingin Sanomat . \n Companies, including UPM, Stora Enso, Metsä Group and Versowood, on Thursday began a lockout at more than 30 facilities, sawmills and board mills, around the country. \n The employer's grouping Finnish Forest Industries is using the lockout to pressure union negotiators at the bargaining table. The dispute centres on efforts by the Industrial Union to eliminate extra working hours that were part of a 2016 pact aimed at improving Finland's competitive position in international markets. \n Talks between the two sides are scheduled to resume on the 17th of this month. Finnish Forest Industries members estimate that the lockout will cost them a total of 5-10 million euros in losses a day. \n Dutiful taxpayers \n Kuopio's  Savon Sanomat  carries a STT news agency report of a survey showing that nearly all Finns are dutiful in paying their taxes on time, and in the words of the paper \"paying with pride\". \n The survey of 1000 taxpayers, commissioned by the Finnish Tax Administration, found that 95 percent said that they pay their taxes on time. \n Also, at 98 percent, they were all but unanimous in agreeing that taxation is important in maintaining a welfare state, while 96 percent see paying taxes as a civic responsibility. \n The lowest positive response was to the question of whether or not people think they get full value for their taxes - 80 percent said they think that they do. \n No, again, to meatless meatballs \n The Pouttu food products company is heading to court in an effort to keep the meat in its meatless meatballs - at least on the packaging, that is. \n The farmers' union daily  Maaseudun Tulevaisuus  reports that on Wednesday the environmental health board of Central Ostrobothnia rejected an appeal to change a decision banning Pouttu from selling prepared foods as \"vegetable meatballs\" and \"vegetable hamburger patties\" \n The company claims that objections to using the terms on packaging and in marketing are no more than its competitors' opposition to its new products. Pouttu says that consumers are savvy enough to understand that packages also carrying the words \"vegan\" or \"other ingredients\" do not contain meat. \n The board of health says that the law requires that information on food packaging must be accurate, clear, and easily understood. In its view \"vegetable meatballs\" don't make the grade. \n The online edition of the news weekly  Suomen Kuvalehti  tells us that the complaint was filed thanks to machinations by Pouttu's rival food manufacturer Atria. Pouttu CEO  Mikko Karell  now plans to challenge the board's ruling in an administrative court. \n Back in 2015, Finnish food giant Kesko  renamed a meatball product  containing only machine-recovered meat, essentially scraps, which are not defined as meat in Finnish law. The product was subsequently marketed on the company's website as \"pyöryköitä\" - or \"balls\" in English."}
{"text": "Just 48 hours after taking office, Finnish Prime Minister  Sanna Marin  spoke to reporters on arrival in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. She will represent European Council president Finland at a series of summit meetings over the next two days. Finnish media representatives were told there would only be time for one or two questions during the brief press conference. \n The first question concerned the new government's stance on the possible return of Finnish family members of Isis fighters from the al-Hol camp in northern Syria. \n The issue has been the focus of intense debate in Finland over the past week or so. Back in Helsinki, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto of the Greens briefed politicians from Marin's Social Democratic Party and main coalition partners the Centre on Thursday amid accusations of secrecy and confusion regarding repatriation plans. Opposition MPs grilled cabinet ministers about it during parliamentary question time that afternoon ahead of a confidence vote next Tuesday. \n When a reporter from business daily Kauppalehti began asking about al-Hol, she was cut off by the Finnish Council of State's long-time Head of Communications for EU Affairs,  Anne Sjöholm . She announced that Marin would only answer questions pertaining to the EU meetings. \n Carbon neutrality by 2050 \"feasible\"  \n Marin did discuss the main topic of the summit, a political commitment for the EU to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. She said that the target was feasible and the overall climate agreement would require compromises from everyone. \n Nuclear power, which Marin opposes, has emerged as a divisive issue between member states. On Wednesday, France and seven Eastern European countries blocked a deal struck last week by the Finnish presidency over concerns that nuclear investments would be hindered if atomic power is not classed as “green and sustainable”. \n Marin also evaluated the waning six-month Finnish presidency, which began just weeks after a new Finnish government took office in June with her as transport minister and SDP colleague  Antti Rinne  as premier. On Tuesday Marin succeeded Rinne at the helm of virtually the same cabinet. The presidency term has been overshadowed at home by months of labour unrest which led to Rinne's resignation, and more broadly by the ongoing Brexit turmoil and a handover in power in the European Council. \n \"We have done good work during a difficult turning point,\" she said. \"I think that Finland has succeeded well as president during this difficult situation.\" \n Finland has come under criticism for its proposal for the EU's multi-annual budget, including for excessive agricultural subsidies in 2021-27."}
{"text": "Helsingin Sanomat writes that it has carried out a long-term  investigation into the background  of the Finnish family members of Isis fighters currently held at the al-Hol camp in northern Syria. The paper says it has used a large number of sources for its report. The information has not, however, been confirmed by Finnish officials. \n Helsingin Sanomat says that the 11 women come from various parts of Finland. Over half of them are ethnic Finns. Most of the children are under the age of six. Some of the women moved to Syria before Isis rose to power in the region, but all decided to stay until the end of the so-called \"caliphate\". \n These Finnish nationals are being held at the al-Hol refugee camp under conditions similar to those of a prisoner of war camp. They are guarded by soldiers of the Syrian Democratic Forces and are unable to leave the camp. \n Helsingin Sanomat reports it has identified 10 of the 11 women. The paper has not released their names. \n Most of the Finnish nationals in the camp are minors. The majority were born in Syria. By law they are entitled to Finnish nationality, as at least one parent was a Finnish citizen. \n The paper writes that it knows of 28 of these children, but there are probably 30. At least two of the women entered adulthood while in Syria. \n Helsingin Sanomat says that the Finnish nationals in Syria formed a close network, many being linked by family ties, marriage, or mutual friends. \n Still no decision \n The newsstand tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat  notes that government question time in parliament on Thursday did not provide any further clarity about whether the government intends to move ahead on repatriating the Finnish nationals held in the al-Hol camp. \n Responding to a question on the issue from an opposition Finns Party MP, Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  was vague,  repeating an earlier statement that the government had discussed the matter in informal talks . \n Haavisto also sidestepped a question asking why he has shifted responsibility for the matter to members of the civil service. \n Centre party chair and finance minister,  Katri Kulmuni , who was standing in for Prime Minister  Sanna Marin , did not give a direct answer to the question of what the government's policy is. \n \"The government has made no decision in this matter. The government will respond to the  opposition's interpellation  on Tuesday,\" was Kulmuni's only reply. \n In a Lännen Media item published by Turku's  Turun Sanomat , political analyst  Anita Simola  says that a decision is being delayed above all over the fear of how it will affect support for the parties in the coalition government. \n Reaction to a repatriation decision is, she writes, a very sensitive topic, and there are fears that supporters will shift their backing to the Finns Party which is already leading the polls. \n Simola goes on to write, \"It is good to remember that this government has been in power for only a few days. If this new generation left-centre government is brought down by the 40 Finns in al-Hol, what then? The phrase 'government crisis' has already been thrown around. The need for a joint decision is extremely urgent.\" \n EU green deal \n European leaders reached an agreement in Brussels on climate change late Thursday night, striking a new \"green deal\" targeting carbon neutrality within the EU by 2050. Only one member state, Poland, declined to commit to the deal, but will reopen discussions on the agreement in June of next year. \n Commenting to a reporter for the daily of Finland's farmers' union,  Maaseudun Tuelevaisuus , Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin described the deal as a major achievement that has been one of the priorities of Finland's current EU presidency. \n According to Marin, the cost of measures to reach carbon neutrality are the reason some member countries were reluctant to sign up. She told the paper though that she believes that by next June all EU countries will get on board. \n \"I hope we can all take part in the same journey,\" said the Finnish PM. \n Safety feature or money maker? \n Oulu's  Kaleva reports  on discontent over the placement of  automated speed cameras on Finnish roads and highways . \n The Heritage Association of National Traffic Police, a group that includes traffic safety efforts among it activities, says that there is no sense in the choice of sites for speed cameras. \n In a release on the subject, the association says that the only reason to use speed cameras is to improve road safety. Its view is that they are being misused by locating them mainly on sections of straight roads with good visibility where passing in traffic is not a problem. \n It points to practice in neighbouring Sweden where drivers are given advance notice of upcoming speed cameras and the speed limit in force, and where close to 100 percent of cameras are used on sections of roads with reduced speed limits or at intersections. \n The association says that in Finland the cameras are regarded as automatic fine issuing machines. \n \"In Finland, speed cameras are in the main installed on highways in the middle of straight stretches where is it completely safe to pass other vehicles and where accidentally getting a speeding ticket is very possible,\" it wrote in a release. \n Along with the Automobile and Touring Club of Finland, this group of former traffic cops is pressing the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency to draw up a more traffic safety-oriented scheme for where the cameras should go. \n Missing PM and an apology \n Iltalehti reports  that there was a delay in Brussels Thursday evening when EU leaders gathered for their traditional summit \"family portrait\". One was missing - Finland's new prime minister, Sanna Marin. \n The delay led photographers to scurry around looking for the Finnish PM, and reportedly President of the European Council  Charles Michel  was just getting ready to call off the shoot when Marin rushed in along the red carpet and took a place front and centre. \n Iltalehti says it does not know why she kept everyone waiting. \n Marin issued an apology during the evening, not about the photo session, but to the Finnish media  for having their questions cut short  at her brief Q&A session upon arrival at the summit. \n Kuopio's  Savon Sanomat  reported that she used her Twitter account to apologise, adding that her press officer had been too abrupt, and to explain that she was in a rush to meet with the president of the European Council."}

In that context, the president noted that we now have more information than ever available, but that development has also brought half-truths and lies into social debate. \n \"And if we go in that direction, this will become a hard place to live for everyone.

{"text": "Political parties in Finland have been in a tug-of-war over the principles related to repatriating Finnish citizens from the al-Hol refugee camp in northern Syria for weeks. On Monday President  Sauli Niinistö  drew his line in the sand  in the form of a personal blog post . \n Niinistö began his missive by saying that he would not be backing any particular party line, repeating twice that the government knows his stance, but that he will not be influencing the work of Parliament. He then proceeded to outline his own opinion on dealing with the humanitarian catastrophe. \n \"Finland should help children. While dissenting views on Finland's legal obligation have apparently been expressed, the moral duty is clear. This same duty does not extend to the children's mothers, although as citizens they retain the right to consular services,\" the President wrote online on Monday. \n Niinistö said that problems arise when providing aid to the children is hindered by their mothers' insistence on staying and traveling with them. The Kurdish Regional Government, which controls the camp, says that children cannot be repatriated without their mothers. \n The al-Hol camp has a capacity of 10,000 people, but with the apparent downfall of terrorist organisation Isis the encampment's displaced population has swelled to some 70,000 individuals. About 40 of them are Finnish citizens, mostly children; the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) considers repatriated Finns from al-Hol to be security risks despite having the capacity to monitor the small number of adult women, should they re-enter the country. \n Helsingin Sanomat wrote  that the coalition government has spent the weekend talking over the next steps, and would mull the issue further on Monday, bringing its policy to the table on Tuesday when it responds to the opposition parties' interpellation. \n Estonian interior minister lashes out against Marin \n In diplomatic news, tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat reported Monday  on Estonian Interior Minister  Mart Helme 's abusive attack on Finland's fresh Social Democratic Prime Minister  Sanna Marin . Helme went on Estonian radio to lash out at Marin's past job history, and even drew confusing historical parallels to the Finnish Civil War. \n According to IS, \"now we see that a little check-out girlie has become Prime Minister and some other uneducated street activist becomes an MP,\" Helme said on the TRE radio channel. \"This is symbolic revenge for the 'reds' over the 'whites'. The reds are now in power and they want to make Finland some kind of Euro-province.\" \n According to Estonian public broadcaster ERR, Helme used the word  müüjatüdruk,  a word that literally means \"sales girl\". \n When asked for a response, the Prime Minister's Office communications manager  Päivi Anttikoski  said that the PM had \"no reason\" to comment. However,  regional daily Aamulehti wrote  that late on Sunday Marin posted an innocuous tweet that touched on the minister's comments without explicitly referencing Helme. \n \"I'm extremely proud of Finland. Here the child of a poor family can educate themselves highly and reach many goals in life. A cashier can become Prime Minister, for instance. Finland would not survive without its workers. I highly value the work of every employee, professional and entrepreneur!\" \n IS  wrote again on Monday  that Estonian Prime Minister  Jüri Ratas  was quick to call for \"respectful\" cooperation with \"friend and ally\" Finland. \n \"Cooperation between our countries has nothing to do with the composition of a government coalition or the parties that lead it,\" Ratas was quoted as saying in IS. \n Interior Minister Helme himself  later backpedaled  by saying the views he expressed were not the Estonian government's official stand, but his own personal one and that of his anti-immigrant right-wing party EKRE. \n \"In no way do I question the positive cooperation and friendship between Finland and Estonia. We are sister nations and will remain so. Differences of opinion between politicians do not affect our warm affection for the Finns,\" Helme said. \n Schools drop PE field trips \n Outside of party politics,  Turun Sanomat  wrote about a new Ministry of Education mandate that calls for the scrapping of physical education programmes that require the parents of students to chip in financially. \n Deputy-Ombudsman  Pasi Pölönen  laid down the law in October, saying that Finnish primary education should be entirely free for all students, and so schools should not organise PE trips that require a student's family to cover part of the cost. \n TS reports that primary school staff have been forced to scramble in light of the new demand, overhauling their PE curricula. Vice principal  Tuulia Suominen  from the Maijamäki school in Naantali said that fewer activities would now be available due to education budget limitations. \n \"So far our elective field trips have taken students out to try sports such as rock-climbing, karting, downhill skiing and laser tag. The city pays for the transportation, but students have partly covered other expenditures. The school can afford a few euros per child, and not much more,\" Suominen said in TS. \n Director  Matti Lahtinen  from the Finnish National Agency for Education said the Deputy-Ombudsman's policy is clear, but that many schools will face big changes. \n \"The worry is this will decrease the amount of teaching outside of school proper. I hope municipalities understand that money for that is needed too, so that students do not get treated unequally due to their place of residence.\" \n 12.57: Updated with ERR translation of Helme comment. \n 14.17: Clarified meaning of Estonian word  (müüjatüdruk)."}

The Centre had criticised former PM Antti Rinne for his frequent condemnation of the policies of the Sipilä government. \n She called on the new administration to restore people’s faith in politics. She said that key to achieving that would be improving people’s everyday lives, primarily by boosting employment. \n \"Young people without jobs, the long-term unemployed and part-time workers must get work. This is why employing people and finding jobs must be made easier.

Paula Risikko , who spoke during the party’s turn, said that quicker government action might have already helped Finnish children at the al-Hol camp. \n \"The government’s inability to make political decisions has led to further erosion of citizens' confidence in political decision-making and possibly to the prolonged suffering of children at the al-Hol camp,\" she declared.

Marin put the question directly to the party. \n \"Finland is a constitutional state and my government will hold to that. Having said that, I am looking especially at the opposition and particularly at the National Coalition party and I ask, 'Aren't you ashamed?'\" the PM said. \n In response to Marin’s challenge, NCP MP  Sanni Grahn-Laasonen  pointed out that there would have been no need for an interpellation if the government had spoken openly about its plans. \n The government will face a confidence vote on the al-Hol situation on Wednesday."}

It is strenuous to go through the painful past, but necessary,\" Paltto said. \n The Sámi Parliament accepted the TRC on Tuesday. Vesa Toppari / Yle \n Several statements from Sámi MPs also brought up worries over the hurried timetable of the reconciliation preparations. The deadline for the completed reconciliation is set for 2022, which Sámi Parliament members  Neeta Jääskö  and  Kirsti Kustula  objected was too fast for such an important issue. \n \"It is a very brief window in which to handle such a case.

The custom of giving a Christmas pike dates back to the 18th century, when residents presented it to the monarch for Christmas. It is generally served in a fish stew along with potatoes and swedes. \n Karjalan liitto (the Karelian Association), a group for Winter War evacuees from the region, handed over their signature Karelian pies as well as potato pies baked fresh on Thursday morning. The organisation will celebrate its 80th anniversary in 2020. \n This year’s Finnish Lucia ,  Sara Ray , led a choir and performed the Santa Lucia hymn along with other selections. Additional entertainment was provided by the Helsinki Cathedral boys’ choir, Cantores Minores. \n In 2016, the presidential family’s pet Boston terrier,  Lemu, stole the show  when he was overcome by the presence of fish and ham in the array of gifts."}

{"text": "Speaking on Yle's talk show Ykkösaamu on Saturday, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said she was very pleased with the government’s decision to  repatriate Finnish children  from the al-Hol refugee camp. \n “It’s up to ministry officials to determine whether Finland will also help the mothers,” she said. \n Marin emphasised that it was not up to the government to decide the fate of individual Finns living in the al-Hol refugee camp. \n Earlier this week, Marin caused a political storm when she asked the opposition National Coalition Party (NCP) whether they were “ashamed” for saying that Finland should not help children at al-Hol if it also meant repatriating their mothers. \n “I spoke from the heart,” she told Yle about her strong words directed at the NCP during a  heated parliamentary debate . “I have spent a lot of time thinking about the fate of children at al-Hol and I wondered why the NCP decided to profile itself in this way.” \n Marin also took aim at the NCP for questioning the actions of Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  as he allegedly rolled out a plan to  evacuate the Finnish camp residents  ahead of the government's official policy on the matter. \n She said Haavisto  had the full support  of both the government and legislature. \n “The fact that the Constitutional Law Committee is examining his actions [regarding Finns at al-Hol] is simply a part of the workings of a constitutional democracy.” \n Polls: Residents have confidence in PM \n Marin told Ykkösaamu that just one month ago she would not have believed that she would become premier. And now, less than  two weeks into the job , media outlets have commissioned polls on how people in Finland believe Marin will manage. \n Half of residents surveyed by local news conglomerate Uutissuomalainen said they believed Marin would succeed in her post. A third said they thought she would fail as prime minister and a fifth had no clear opinion. Overall, women placed more faith in Marin than men whereas respondents over the age of 70 had the most confidence in her. \n Eighty-five percent of SDP members said Marin would do well as premier, compared to just 22 percent of Finns Party adherents. \n The poll, which surveyed 1,000 residents, was carried out by pollster Tietoykkönen between 12 and 16 December and carried a 3.1-percentage point margin of error. \n Meanwhile another poll by tabloid Ilta-Sanomat found that a narrow majority believed Marin’s cabinet would remain intact until the end of the government term."}
{"text": "The sale of fireworks for the New Year's season began on Friday, but Finnish consumers are increasingly calling to ban retail sales of the seasonal pyrotechnics. \n A poll by paper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus found that nearly half of respondents (47 percent) said they would support a ban on the retail sales and personal use of fireworks. \n A gender analysis of the results found that 57 percent of women and 38 percent of men are against the use of fireworks by anyone except trained professionals. The results are also relative to age: 60 percent of respondents over the age of 64 would ban New Year's rockets, compared to just 37 percent of those under 30 years old. \n The survey conducted by TNS Kantar Agri interviewed 1,089 Finnish residents. The margin of error for the results is +/- three percentage points. \n Health, safety, environment \n For now, individuals in Finland may set off fireworks between 6 pm on Tuesday 31 December and 2 am on Wednesday 1 January. \n The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency (Tukes) said that safety goggles are compulsory for people who use fireworks; observers should also take precautions to protect their eyes and face. Fireworks cause 10-30 people to be hospitalised every year. \n Tukes found that 13 people were injured by fireworks on last New Year's Eve, only one of whom was wearing goggles at the time. Ten of the victims were setting off fireworks when they were hurt. \n A citizens' initiative to ban the non-professional use of fireworks gathered more than 65,000 signatures in 2018; Parliament's legislative director  Tuula Kulovesi  received the initiative in November. \n The initiative's proposal – which includes concerns over animal rights and the environmental damage caused by thousands of chemical explosions and the resulting debris – is currently under parliamentary deliberation. \n The initiative would not prohibit the use of small pyrotechnics such as sparklers, squibs and Roman candles. \n The value of the annual fireworks market is some 30 million euros, according to the pyrotechnic artists' association PITE. \n Zero major parties on board \n In early December daily Uutissuomalainen published the results of a poll of Finland's political parties on the subject of fireworks. The only group to support the full ban of consumer fireworks was Movement Now (Liike Nyt) and its lone MP,  Harry Harkimo . \n The Finns Party, National Coalition Party and Centre Party all oppose the ban outright.  Hanna-Leena Mattila , the Centre parliamentary group's vice chair, said a prohibition may lead to a rise in dangerous homemade fireworks. \n Responses from the Social Democratic Party, Greens, Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrats indicated that they would investigate the matter before deciding.

{"text": "President  Sauli Niinistö  has rejected all applications for criminal pardons this year, according to daily Helsingin Sanomat. \n HS  reported on Monday  that Niinistö did not exercise his power to free any inmates this year. He denied all fifty applications that came across his desk in 2019, saying that none of them fulfilled the criteria for a presidential pardon. \n \"I have used the right to pardon in situations where the circumstances in a convict's life, relating to health or family for instance, have significantly and substantially changed. That was not the case in any of this year's applications,\" Niinistö said. \n The Supreme Court of Finland (KKO) provides an official statement on the pardon applications as a basis for the president's decision, though the president may override these recommendations. The Supreme Court did not recommend any criminals for pardon in 2019. \n Niinistö has used his power to pardon offenders far more sparingly than previous presidents, giving special consideration to just two people in 2018 and a total of twenty people during his seven years in office. The number of clemency applications from prisoners has also gone down, from over 300 in the 1980s and 90s to fewer than one hundred in recent times. \n Historic powers may shift \n President  Mauno Koivisto  pardoned about fifty people per year in the 1980s. His successor  Martti Ahtisaari  pardoned some thirty people annually, and  Tarja Halonen  pardoned an average of twenty criminals each year she was in office. \n This is the first time in at least 56 years that not a single prisoner was offered clemency, secretary  Johanna Nyberg  from the Ministry of Justice told HS. \n \"Presidents of Finland have offered at least one pardon every year since 1951, until now. We could not find any instances of zero-pardon years before that,\" Nyberg said. \n The Constitution Act of 1919 grants the president the power of pardon. However, Niinistö has stated consistently that he believes special pardons should be within the purview of the Supreme Court instead. His position is still the same, he said. \n \"It's not a top priority, but if the Constitution comes under scrutiny in some other context, this is a feature that should be addressed.\" \n The President's Office  website describes  the appeal process. \n \"In an individual case, the President of the Republic can remit a sentence or other criminal penalty imposed by a court. The President cannot waive obligations based on public or civil law, such as taxes, maintenance payments or bank loans. Anyone can submit a petition for a pardon, which does not require the consent of the person to whom it applies.\""}
{"text": "Foreign Minister  Pekka Haavisto  is a clear favourite to become Finland's next president, according to a poll by tabloid daily Ilta-Sanomat. Some 17 percent of poll respondents threw their support behind the former Greens chair to win the presidential election in 2024. \n Haavisto has come under intense scrutiny in recent times for  his handling of government's plans to repatriate Finnish citizens  at the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria. He later  won a confidence vote  in parliament over the furore. \n Haavisto was a candidate in the 2018 election but came second when incumbent  Sauli Niinistö   won an overwhelming first-round majority of votes  to secure a second term in office. \n Respondents' second-favourite option for president was Centre Party politico and Bank of Finland governor  Olli Rehn , with 10 percent backing. He was followed by current Left Alliance chair and Education Minister  Li Andersson  as well as the Social Democratic Party's EU Commissioner  Jutta Urpilainen  – both of whom claimed seven percent approval to become president. \n Finns Party and National Coalition Party chairs  Jussi Halla-aho  and  Petteri Orpo  respectively both attracted the support of six percent of respondents. A sizeable proportion of the 1,000 respondents surveyed -- 16 percent -- said that could not name a favourite for the next presidential contest, while another 11 percent said they would not vote for any of the alternatives presented. \n Niinistö serving final term \n A similar poll by Alma Media during the autumn also found Haavisto to be a favourite for president, with 33 percent backing him for the post. The Alma Media survey also had Rehn in second place with support from 11 percent of voters. In this poll however, Halla-aho and Helsinki mayor  Jan Vapaavuori  claimed third spot with 10 percent support. The polls are not comparable because the number of respondents and candidate line-up were different. \n Pollster Taloustutkimus conducted the survey for IS, and research head  Tuomo Turja  told the paper that the al-Hol flap did not seem to directly influence the outcome, but he speculated that it may have. \n Niinistö is currently in his second and final term in office and cannot stand for re-election in 2024. After the last presidential election in 2018, another IS poll found that 27 percent of voters backed Haavisto for president. \n Taloustutkimus interviewed 1,004 respondents for the poll between 9 and 17 December. The poll's margin of error was +/- 3.2 percentage points. The Alma Media poll was conducted last autumn by Tietoykkönen and surveyed 1,500 people."}
